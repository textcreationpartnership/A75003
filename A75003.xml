            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:135604:7"/>that periſh, and made him Heavens great favourite and darling; which if it had been carefully preſerved, had undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſecured our firſt Parents in Paradiſe, and prevented that dreadful calamity that hath ſeized upon their Poſterity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But</hi> alas! how are we fallen from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Earth? from a Paradiſe of pure pleaſures, to a miſerable and painful Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? We have loſt that divine Image that was impreſſed upon Man in his primitive ſtate, which indeed compleated, and alone preſerved its beauty and comelineſs; and with it have alſo loſt every thing that did then contribute to make us happy; and are now become vile and abominable, and as miſerable as we were formerly happy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How</hi> much a ſerious view of that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive felicity Man in his innocent ſtate enjoyed, would contribute to plant in us a holy life, I know not: but I am ſure it could not but mightily inhaunce the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and make it lovely and deſirable. <hi>That</hi> man that reflects upon the diſmal miſeries he is expoſed to in this lapſed eſtate, to what an infinite number of inexpreſſible evils, of inſupportable pains he lies upon; how he is hurried from a ſtate of perfect bliſs, to a woful
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:135604:7"/>hell of extream torments: How excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly amazing is this? The very Poet could ſay, <hi>Miſerum eſt ſuiſſe heatum.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>But,</hi> God knows, this is out very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom (and if ever, but faintly) reflected upon: we are (to our ſharow) become contented ſlaves, and ſatisfied to bear Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Chains; we continually live in the midſt of all evil, never enjoy a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſolace or comfort: notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which, like mad-men we are content with our ſtate, and like the Sow take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to puddle in the mire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And</hi> although that ſame diffuſive and boundleſs goodneſs that firſt breathed in us the breath of life, and framed us in his own likeneſs and image, again pitied us in our low eſtate, and provided the moſt valuable and Soveraign remedie to recover us from this mortal diſeaſe; though he has procured a compleat Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom to liberate us from the inſupportable ſlavery and tyranny of ſin; has offered to reſtore our former beautie, to repoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs us of that happineſs we had loſt, and to make us again Favourites and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; yet how inſolently have we reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted this kinde offer? how impiouſly have we cut thoſe cords of love aſunder, and refuſe to be healed?</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>'Tis,</hi> indeed, matter of great ſadneſs to conſider the lofty and intolerable affronts that are now caſt upon Holineſs; how men are arrived at that pitch of impietie, to ſcorn and deride Religion, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages were at ſome pains to advance; as if Holineſs were inconſiſtent with the principles of Generoſity, and onely beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming mean and moroſe ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How</hi> tranſcendent a folly and madneſs this is, will eaſily appear by what I ſhall afterwards lay down. Methinks the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked repreſentation of Holineſs, ſhould be motive enough (if not to court it, yet) to engage men to correct their unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable prejudices they entertain againſt it; and even force its greateſt Antagoniſts to become its Advocates. But alas! vice hath caſt ſuch a dark ſhadow upon mens Judgements, that they are become as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit Judges of its beauty, as blind men are of colours; otherwiſe we might yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to ſee contemned Vertue much more in vogue than ever Vice was.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To</hi> excite our deſires, Scripture has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented it under the moſt comely dreſs, has diſcovered its beauty and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and recommended it by the moſt endearing motives which are apt to work both upon our hope and fear: <hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It</hi> would make (one would think) the greateſt Senſualiſt to relinquiſh the momentary pleaſures he enjoys here, to be poſſeſt of thoſe eternal joys that the pure in ſpirit ſhall reap <hi>in the Kingdom of their Father:</hi> and the moſt hardned and impregnable ſinner tremble, to think of <hi>dwelling with devouring flames.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Now</hi> the onely infallible way to attain thoſe coeleſtial felicities, and to evite the miſerable conſequences of vice, and thoſe pains and tortures that it expoſeth its vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries to, is to abandon every luſt, be it never ſo impetuous, and to <hi>cleanſe our ſelves</hi> (as the Apoſtle adviſeth us) <hi>from all filthineſs of the fleſh and ſpirit, and to

                     <p>I Intend not here to deſcend to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of every particular branch of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> but to diſcourſe of it in the general, as it is the <hi>combination of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian vertues:</hi> and as it is thus conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I need not, I think, in the deſcription of it, accurately ſtudy all thoſe Logical rules Philoſophers require in a good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition. For may part, it fully enough ſatisfies me to know, that <hi>holineſs</hi> is <hi>a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Divine Law,</hi> and <hi>a hearty and ſincere compliance with thoſe original dictates of humane nature, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands revealed in ſacred Writ.</hi>

                        <hi>So</hi> long as Man remained obedient to the Laws of his Maker, his <hi>holineſs</hi> was untainted, and his Beauty and primitive congenite comelineſs continued; but by his woeful apoſtacy he loſt that noble embelliſhment of his nature, which did indeed give a grace to all his other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, and is now become ugly and deformed <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>purity of Spirit</hi> are different words, but of the ſame ſignification, and are promiſcuouſly uſed in Scripture to expreſs the ſame

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs: Sin</hi> being that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminates the Soul, and robs it of that beauty which formerly did of right belong to it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Although</hi> 'tis not one particular good action that denominates a man <hi>holy;</hi> yet every wilful aberration from, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law, conſtitutes man a ſinner, and makes him liable to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit of the offence. Whoſoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore intends <hi>to perfect holineſs,</hi> muſt (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Apoſtle's advice) <hi>cleanſe himſelf from all filthineſs of the fleſh and ſpirit, abſtain from every appearance of evil,</hi> and ſincerely endeavour to perform all good actions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In</hi> a word, <hi>Holineſs</hi> in its general no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is <hi>the comprehenſive ſum of the moral Law;</hi> and may be very aptly deſcribed to be <hi>a ceaſing from evil, and doing good;</hi> which in this lapſed eſtate conſiſts in the ſincerity of our intentions and actions, and ſhall be perfected when <hi>mortality is ſwallowed up of life,</hi> when thoſe imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and ſpots that attend our natural ſtate, ſhall be quite removed and done away. So long as our ſouls actuate their impure bodies, ſins and infirmities will cleave to the beſt: an abſolute innocence
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:135604:10"/>and perfect <hi>holineſs</hi> is reſerved for that ſtate, <hi>where all things are become new.</hi> But yet ſo far as the frailty of our nature, and the imperfection of our preſent ſtate will ſuffer, we ought ſincerely to ſtudy to <hi>walk</hi> (as it is ſaid of <hi>Zacharias</hi> and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth) in all the Commandments of God blameleſs;</hi> the general courſe and tenour of our lives ſhould correſpond and keep a conformity with the divine precepts, which, as I ſhall juſt now ſhew, are <hi>the rule of holineſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Almighty</hi> God, who well conſiders the nature of man, does not eſteem men to be either vicious or holy, from the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of ſome particular acts: <hi>There is not a juſt man who liveth and ſinneth not.</hi> It is the peculiar <hi>motto</hi> of our Lord Chriſt, That <hi>he did no ſin, neither was there guile found in his mouth.</hi> But the imperfect obedience of good men, who in the general courſe of their life ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtudy an univerſal conformity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the divine Laws, is eſteemed by him <hi>who judgeth righteouſly</hi> to be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in order to our acceptance with him, upon the account of the merits and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience of our bleſſed Saviour. The wiſe God, who conſiders the frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and imperfections that attend our
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:135604:11"/>preſent ſtate, expects not more from us than we are able to perform. He is not ſo rigorous a Lord, to require <hi>Brick where there is no Straw:</hi> the terms of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel are accommodated to our capacities, and onely require a <hi>holineſs</hi> which is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for the Creature to attain; at leaſt it exacts and expects no more, but that we endeavour ſincerely and unfeignedly to obey all thoſe precepts he has enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that we habituate our ſelves to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form good actions; that the general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion and inclination of our wills and appetites be towards the doing of what is impoſed upon us, and abſtaining from all kind of evil.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>By</hi> what hath been ſaid, it may appear, that <hi>holineſs</hi> conſiſts not in Speculation, but in Practice: 'Tis not the knowledge of duty, but the actual performance of it that entitles men to be holy; and that too, not ſuperficially, or in a good mode, and rarely performed; but ſincerely, and throughout the whole courſe of our lives. For men to know their duty and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, is to inhaunce their own miſery, and to ſecure to themſelves double ſtripes: and to perform ſome good actions, and abſtain from the groſſer pollutions of the world, and yet to be vicious in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:135604:11"/>courſe of their lives, this is ſuch a holineſs that will never profit any man. The <hi>rule of holineſs,</hi> to which we muſt heartily ſtudy an actual conformity, does not diſpenſe, no not with the commiſſion of the leaſt ſin, nor omiſſion of the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt duty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But</hi> becauſe general deſcriptions of things are frequently overlooked, I ſhall not think it unneceſſary to deſcend to a more particular ſurvey, and conſider <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> in its ſeveral branches, as they are plainly deſcribed by the Chriſtian rule of Holineſs.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>I am</hi> a little confident, it will not be expected I ſhould prove that the New Teſtament is of Divine Authority, and conſequently an infallible <hi>rule</hi> to direct us in the way of <hi>holineſs:</hi> the numerous late Diſcourſes, which have excellently well performed this task, againſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly prophane Atheiſts this impure age hath to its laſting reproach hatched, makes me without the leaſt fear of cenſure ſuperſede this undertaking.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I ſhall</hi> take it then for granted, (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acknowledged by all rational men) that the Goſpel is the great and certain Standard whereby we may truly judge of any man's <hi>holineſs;</hi> and never doubt to conclude, that he who in the general courſe and tenour of his life walks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the <hi>Rule,</hi> can lay no claim, plead no intereſt to the title of <hi>Holineſs;</hi> this being no other thing (as I have already ſhewed) but a combination of thoſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues the Goſpel-precepts enjoyn.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Now</hi> the precepts of Chriſtianity which point us our duty, may, for brevity, be reduced to theſe three general Heads. For <hi>firſt,</hi> they are either ſuch as enjoyn Piety towards God. <hi>Secondly,</hi> or ſuch that require the good government of our ſelves. Or <hi>thirdly,</hi> thoſe that preſcribe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:135604:12"/>our carriage and be haviour towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Of theſe I ſhall take a brief ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey; and as I go along, excite men to the practice of every particular duty, by rational motives and inducements; and withal diſcover the perfection and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatneſs of the Chriſtian <hi>Rule,</hi> above all the Inſtitutions that ever were or can be deviſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> amongſt thoſe Laws of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity which enjoyn Piety towards God, we find Love to him ſtanding in the front, and claiming the precedency. This is (as our bleſſed Saviour informs us) <hi>the firſt and great Commandment,</hi> it being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the ſcource and original of all acts of obedience.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To</hi> excite our <hi>Love,</hi> let us but preſent to our view his infinite and tranſcendent perfections, the undeſerved favours he every minute beſtows upon us, the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable dangers and accidents we are daily preſerved from: Arguments forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enough to draw Love from the moſt rocky and obdurate heart. 'Tis indeed an amazing thing, to ſee thoſe into whom he has breathed the Breath of Life, on whom he has rained ſo many floods of favours, to remain notwithſtanding as frozen, as ground which the Sun-rays ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:135604:13"/>touch. Tis an odd and ſtrange ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that ſtreams of Love onely meet with contempt and diſdain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sure</hi> I am, there is a concurrence of all ſorts of motives and arguments to engage us to love God; and thoſe indeed ſo charming and endearing, that it is ſtrange any body ſhould fail in it. Methinks the work it ſelf is ſo ſweet and delectable, ſo raviſhing and lovely, that men need not be courted to it by perſwaſion. O what a great deal of ſatisfaction, of ineffable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, does the devout ſoul find in thoſe actings of love towards God! And if the Voluptuous and Senſualiſt would but abandon thoſe ſinful delights he now findes ſo charming and bewitching, and betake himſelf to the practice of holineſs: If he would change the object of his love, and place it where it ought to be; I doubt not but he ſhould quickly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive there is more pleaſure, more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment and ſatisfaction in the love of God, than in the enjoyment of all carnal pleaſures.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That</hi> man that ſhall make a juſt eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of things, ſhall be eaſily convinced there is nothing worthy of love in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of God.

                        </gap>. Its beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſplendour is but gilded and delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory: and is it reaſonable, nay, is it not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream madneſs, to place the ſtrength of our affections on ſuch uncertain and quickly-removed vanities?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The</hi> uſual arguments of love amongſt men, are Relation, Intereſt, or the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Excellency of the Object. Now all theſe lay much ſtronger obligations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us to love God. For Relation, is he not our Lord and Maker, who gave us life and being, who as a tender Father kindely compaſſionates our condition, and in our low eſtate has carefully min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us, when our other Relations have accounted us aliens and ſtrangers? This the Royal Pſalmiſt experimented; and I make no queſtion but many good men have been, and are living inſtances of this truth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And</hi> indeed, that man that conſults his own intereſt, cannot but be ſtrongly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to love that God who is the beſt benefactor, and equally willing and able to beſtow favours upon him. It is an argument of a very baſe and mean ſpirit, to deſpiſe our benefactors: but thus have we requited God, who daily loadeth us with mercies, and reneweth his bleſſings
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:135604:14"/>every morning: we have, God knows, moſt inſolently carried our ſelves, even then, when he has been diſplaying a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of love over us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As</hi> for Beauty and Excellency, what in the world can compete with him, <hi>who is glorious in holineſs,</hi> and <hi>whoſe Name is excellent in all the earth?</hi> How quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are all created beauties winked into darkneſs? At the beſt they are but ſtreams derived from this glorious being; and is it not hugely reaſonable, that he who is the original of theſe, ſhould be the chief object of our love, and make us with the Pſalmiſt ſay, <hi>Whom have I in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but thee; and there is none upon the earth I deſire beſides thee?</hi>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:135604:14"/>hard is it to convince men of the folly, the extream and ſtrange madneſs, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>lovers of pleaſures more than lovers of God?</hi> But the truth is, there is ſuch a mire and puddle of pollution in our hearts, that it quite choaks &amp; extinguiſheth all ſparks of Love, makes us violate the principles of humanity, and become more ungueate than the beaſts who have no underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But</hi> if this Divine flame be kindled in our Hearts, if it be ſincere and ſuperla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive as it ought to be, it will eaſily employ all the faculties of our Soul in his ſervice; it will engage, and enable us too, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the ſeveral Duties of Piety the Laws of Chriſtianity enjoyn: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſome of the particular branches of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> I ſhall briefly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with their encouragements; and for method and order reduce to four Heads. <hi>Firſt,</hi> it will inſtruct and enable us to truſt and depend upon God. <hi>Secondly,</hi> to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and obey his Will. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reverence his great and ſacred Name. And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> to worſhip and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore him according to the method he hath himſelf preſcribed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I begin</hi> with the firſt, namely, That Love where it is ſincere, is a noble and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:135604:15"/>paſſion, apt to excite and enable us to depend on God. This is, I confeſs, a duty very uſeful, and never out of ſeaſon: the Pſalmiſt wiſely adviſeth us, <hi>to truſt in him at all times,</hi> when we are in the midſt of all trouble, as well as when our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſerene, and wholly exempt from outward fears. When the divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath placed us in the moſt diſmal circumſtances, even in this ſad and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſs ſtate, our fears ought to give place to faith; we would do well to repoſe a ſpecial confidence in him, who is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by become engaged to ſecure and defend us. This method the excellent Pſalmiſt obſerved, and reſolved conſtantly to heed in times of imminent danger: <hi>What time I am afraid I will truſt in thee,</hi> Pſal. 56.3. and we find that faithful men in former times took this courſe alſo: <hi>We know not what to do, onely our eyes are to thee,</hi> 2 Chron. 20.12.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In</hi> this lapſed ſtate we lie open to a multitude of accidents; every place is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with dangers; our enemies are as ſubtile and cunning, as they are ſtrong and numerous. The Prince of the power of the Air has his wit always upon the rack, in inventing ſtratagems and devices to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do us; and his Emiſſaries ſlip no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:135604:15"/>of our ruine: and is there a ſafer courſe than to <hi>truſt in Jehovah, who is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting ſtrength?</hi> who is indeed, as the Pſalmiſt ſays, <hi>a preſent help in time of need.</hi> Sure I am, it is mans greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to flee to the Divine Providence, which is the beſt guard againſt all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; for we need not doubt to conclude with the Apoſtle. <hi>If God be with us, who can be againſt us?</hi>

Therefore</hi>
                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:135604:16"/>(ſays our Lord) <hi>I ſay unto you, Take no thought for your life, what you ſhall eat, or what you ſhall drink; neither for your body, what ye ſhall put on: Is not the life more than meat? and the body than rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?

'Tis rejected and condemned as a Pagan &amp; Heatheniſh ſin, to be querulons and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous of <hi>what we ſhall eat, or what we ſhall drink, or wherewithal we ſhall be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed: for after all theſe things do the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſeek,</hi> v. 31, 32.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I confeſs,</hi> as I cannot ſufficiently enough pity the madneſs of ſome men, who will truſt God with their Souls, but not with their ſecular Concerns; ſo could I never yet project what may be the reaſon why better men than the former are ſo apt to diſtruſt God in times of danger and want.

For if we did indeed think that he takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:135604:16"/>of us, we could not but confidently rely upon his care.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> we are by the perfect rule of Piety and Holineſs inſtructed to ſubmit to the divine Will, and comply with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel precepts, which concerning all things are right. Perhaps the lot infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom has carved out to us, is no ways re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing to fleſh and blood.

However, let us not, even under theſe ſad circumſtances, <hi>charge God fooliſhly,</hi> or be impatient under the ſeverity of his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; for this is no argument of the hatred of a Father. Let us rather in this caſe view the unſpeakable reward, and the divine promiſes, which are ſufficiunt arguments to revive our ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> if ever they attained to a perfection in any vertue, it was in their patience under the inſtability of worldly things; and yet their grounds and motives to patience were ſandy and ineffectual, and no ways comparable to the arguments
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:135604:17"/>and inducements laid down in the Scheme of Chriſtian Religion. <hi>Epicurus</hi> his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to minde his former pleaſures, was but a weak plea to form him to patience under the tormenting pains of the Gout. And the <hi>Stoicks</hi> notion that ſufferings were no real evils, was <hi>really</hi> a fancy eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conquered by the extremity of pain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And</hi> as we are thus obliged to ſubmit to the ſevereſt diſpenſation of Providence, ſo we ought to comply with the divine will exhibited in his Precepts. <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> is undoubtedly the beſt evidence of Love; <hi>for hereby is our love manifeſted, that we do his will:</hi> and indeed the divine injunctions are ſo natural, ſo equitable and juſt, that we can alleadge no impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility in performing them. <hi>His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi> as the Apoſtle informs us, <hi>are not grievous,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.3. they require not things incommodious and burthenſome, as the moſt of other Religions do.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The</hi> third duty we are inſtructed in, is to reverence and honour his ſacred Name, to have apprehenſions and affections ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to his glorious perfections. When we ſeriouſly reflect on the purity of his nature, and the infinity of his cognizance; our eſteem and veneration of him ſhould be truely elevated, and raiſed as high as
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:135604:17"/>poſſible, and make us with <hi>Moſes</hi> (in a holy rapture) ſay, <hi>Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the Gods! who is like thee, glorious in holineſs, fearful in praiſes, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wonders?</hi> Exod. 15.11.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>How</hi> impious then and unlawful is it, to prophane and violate the ſacred Name of that God we ſhould adore, by a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of raſh and cuſtomary oaths! Sure thoſe who own any relation to that God who is ſo diſhonoured, will be ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as to expreſs their diſpleaſure, when in company with thoſe who thus revile him. But if God be ſo friendleſs as to have none to appear thus for him, yet ſuch prophane wretches may know, that God himſelf will reſent thoſe injuries and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts put upon him; he will vindicate his own glory of which he is ſo jealous, and ſurely <hi>will not hold them guiltleſs that take his Name in vain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Of</hi> all ſins, this of Swearing is the moſt unreaſonable, and cannot pretend the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary incentives of Pleaſure or Profit, that moſt of Vices lay ſome claim to. How deſperate a phrenſie then is it, for men without any probability of allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to draw down upon themſelves the vengeance of an incenſed God? 'Tis ſure but a mean Apology, to alleadge an
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:135604:18"/>habit and cuſtome, while this is the very thing that enhances their guilt: neither will it, I think, a whit leſſen the Crime, that Great perſons have given it ſuch a vogue in the world.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The</hi> Name of God is a ſacred thing, which muſt not be appealed to, but in the moſt weighty and ſerious caſes: <hi>Thou ſhalt ſwear</hi> (ſays the Prophet) <hi>that the Lord liveth, in truth, juſtice, and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> If we either affirm or promiſe any thing by oath, it muſt be after mature deliberation, after we have aſcertained our ſelves of the truth and lawfulneſs of it: this the very Poet could dictate,
<q>
                           <hi>Nec Deus interſit, niſi dign us vindice nodus Inciderit—</hi>
                        </q> 
                        <hi>It</hi> were to be wiſhed, that the Hectors of this age would learn of the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens more reverence; and that thoſe men that pretend to good breeding, would be ſo civil, even ſometimes for the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies ſake, as to forbear thoſe Oaths that tender ears cannot hear without offence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In</hi> the laſt place, the Divine Love, if ſcattered in our Hearts, will excite us to worſhip God after the method himſelf hath preſcribed: It will direct us to the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:135604:18"/>rule of Piety, where we ſhall finde every thing that relates to our immediate inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with God in Divine Ordinances and Worſhip exactly ordered. I confeſs, the Heathen world, as they were confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in their notions of a Deity, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt quite ignorant of the eternal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; ſo were they ſuperſtitious in their Worſhip, and ſometimes ignorantly ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Altars to <hi>an unknown God.</hi> Their Worſhip was attended with a great deal of external pomp, was very grateful to their external ſenſes; but it reached not the Heart. But the Chriſtian rule in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs us to worſhip God in Spirit, and preſcribes the beſt method of devotion: It requires that <hi>We worſhip and bow before the Lord our maker,</hi> with all poſſible hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and reverence; that we poſſeſs our Hearts with the greatneſs and glory of that Majeſty we adore; that we be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in our devotion, and not ſuffer ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>

How many attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives are there to approach his preſence, <hi>who dwells in light unacceſſible?</hi> Have we not a multitude of ſins to confeſs? many wants we would fain have ſuppli'd? How many temptations does every place preſent? How numerous are the dangers and accidents to which we lie open? and ſhould not all theſe excite us to render homage to that omnipotent power, which alone can guard us from inconveniences? But beſides our dangers we are freed from, the mercies and favours he daily confers upon us, the freſh communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his bounty every morning, nay minute, require at leaſt a return of praiſe, and a grateful acknowledgment. But yet alaſs! in ſpight of all theſe induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, how is Devotion contemned by ſome, and neglected by moſt?</p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>As</hi> to the firſt, we are by the perfect <hi>rule of Holineſs</hi> inſtructed to live ſoberly, to be moderate in all things, and to ſhun every kinde of exceſs, as equally hurtful to Soul and Body: it forbids complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in thoſe luſts that war againſt both; reſtrains all irregular and impetuous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations; retrenches all inordinate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, the firſt motions to forbidden ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and, in a word, enjoyns all thoſe vertues which reſpect either our <hi>Bodies</hi> or <hi>Souls.</hi>

We may
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:135604:20"/>indeed very aptly write to the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of this age, as the great Apoſtle did to the Church of <hi>Corinth: It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and ſuch fornication as is not ſo much as named amongſt the Gentiles,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.1. And I am a little afraid, if the Church ſhould ſtrictly obſerve that charge that the Apoſtle gives there, and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate all ſuch wicked perſons, that our Church ſhould not need to brag much of the number of Chriſtians.</p>

                        <hi>If</hi> we enquire narrowly into the Lives of Heathen Philoſophers, we ſhall finde their <hi>pride</hi> and vain-glory ſtained the beſt of their actions. <hi>Self-denial</hi> was a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue never taught in their Schools; and for <hi>Contentment,</hi> the rules they preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed were but ineffectual to recommend it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But</hi> the Goſpel couples our Duty and Intereſt together; it commands <hi>Humility,</hi> and recommends its advantages and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring attractives. It diſcovers the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that attend <hi>Pride;</hi> and the great folly of being vain of Beauty, Strength, Wit, Riches, Honours, or Preferments: Of all theſe I may uſe the Apoſtle's phraſe, <hi>'Tis not expedient doubtleſs for men to glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.7. Are not theſe the free gifts of Divine goodneſs? and what can be more unreaſonable than for depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent creatures to be proud?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Humility</hi> is indeed ſo amiable, ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing

                        </gap>ity and ſo noble an embe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment of our nature, that where this is wanting, all other advantages are little regarded; and not onely men, but the great God alſo <hi>reſiſts the proud,</hi> it being a vice which, beſides Chriſtianity, Morality alſo condemns, as univerſally unbecoming to Humane nature; and that which not onely diſturbs ones ſelf, but alſo diſquiets whole ſocieties: But <hi>God gives grace to the humble;</hi> he takes ſuch perſons into favour, as being more pliable to receive the impreſs of his love.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And</hi> as a humble, ſo alſo a <hi>meek</hi> and quiet ſpirit <hi>is in the ſight of God of great price.</hi> And can there be a more convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing motive than this, to recommend meekneſs to Chriſtians? And indeed we cannot pretend to be the Diſciples of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Jeſus, if we refuſe to learn that leſſon he hath copied out to us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Although</hi> a calm and quiet ſpirit is a reward to it ſelf, as every vertue is; yet it wants not a claim to a temporal felicity alſo, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Bleſſed are the meek, for they ſhall inherit the earth.</hi> Theſe be the perſons to whom by right of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe this ſtately Fabrick of earth belongs.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:135604:22"/>And if we now view that unpleaſant vice of <hi>Anger</hi> oppoſite to it, this will yet adde more to its luſtre, and help to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it the more effectually. <hi>Anger</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch an unpleaſant humour, that it makes thoſe men it poſſeſſes unfit for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſociety, it being not unfitly defined by the Poet to be <hi>a ſhort madneſs;</hi> which indeed agrees very well with the Wiſe mans verdict of it, <hi>Eccl. Anger reſts in the boſom of fools.</hi> If then men would but compare the calm and happy ſereni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Meekneſs, with that inward and outward trouble and diſquietment that is the effect of Anger, they could not but eſteem the one, and declaim againſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In</hi> the next place, our <hi>Chriſtian rule</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends <hi>Contentment</hi> as the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Jewel in the Saints Diadem; 'tis that noble ingredient that makes the moſt bitter cup ſweet and pleaſant: it renders things, otherwiſe unſavory and burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, to be indeed reliſhing and eaſie. This is it that ſeaſons the meaneſt meal; makes a diſh of herbs a feaſt, and a cup of cold water pleaſe the palate: This is that vertue which makes men in the midſt of ſtorms repreſent a calm, and in the ſaddeſt circumſtances to ſing ſweetly. He
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:135604:23"/>who has learned St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s leſſon <hi>how to want, and how to abound,</hi> is not diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed either by Proſperity or Adverſity; but in both caſes can behave himſelf like a man in reaſon. This is it which is inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably connected with Godlineſs, is the ſame thing expreſſed by different names. This is a vertue ſo lovely and deſirable, attended with ſo many advantages, that we have all imaginable encouragements to hearken to the Apoſtles advice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Be content with ſuch things as ye have;</hi> and in the evil day to heed that advice Chriſt gives his Diſciples, to <hi>poſſeſs our ſouls with patience.</hi>

                        <hi>But</hi> how diſquieting and tormenting are its contraries? <hi>Ambition</hi> makes men reſtleſs in raiſing their own value and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem above others; it prompts them to be always in diſlike with their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition; the leaſt advancement of others above them, gnaws and torments their ſpirits, and oftentimes hurries them headlong to the greateſt dangers. <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring</hi> is a moſt fretting evil, a moſt pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſtemper, a ſin attended with the moſt dangerous conſequents, and which imbittereth the happieſt ſtate of life here. <hi>Envy</hi> is a vice nothing leſs criminal, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with as diſmal effects as any, as the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:135604:23"/>Apoſtle St. <hi>James</hi> tells, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Where envying and ſtrife is, there is confuſion and every evil work.</hi> And laſtly, <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> is ſo mean and ignoble a vice, that I think although it were not (as the Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes it) <hi>the root of all evil;</hi> yet gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant ſpirits ſhould diſlike it, as being baſe and contemptible.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In</hi> the laſt place, the Goſpel recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends <hi>Self-denial</hi> as the Chriſtians pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Character: <hi>If any man</hi> (ſays our Maſter Chriſt) <hi>will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his croſs and follow me:</hi> And this precept he backs with the moſt powerful incitement; <hi>For whoſoever will ſave his life ſhall loſe it, and whoſoever will loſe his life for my ſake, ſhall find it,</hi> Mat. 16.24, 25. I doubt not but fleſh and bloud will cry out, as once Chriſt's own Diſciples did in another caſe, <hi>This is a hard ſaying, who can bear it?</hi> 'Tis indeed no ſmall matter to bring down the carnal part of man to ſubmit to the loſs of Relations, Intereſt, and Life: But ſince the advantage and danger of both caſes is ſo clearly revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, what fools will men prove, if to gain this life, they loſe the recompence of a better rewad?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As the rule of Holineſs</hi> does thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:135604:24"/>us in thoſe duties that concern our ſelves; ſo it alſo teacheth us how to carry towards others. And in the firſt place, it recommends the <hi>Royal Law of love,</hi> as the ſpring and ſource of all other duties, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.9. <hi>If there be any other commandment, 'tis briefly comprehended in this ſaying, namely, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> This, for its excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and comprehenſiveneſs, is ſaid to be <hi>the fulfilling of the Law,</hi> as thoſe who neglect it are ſaid <hi>to ſin againſt the Law.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>And</hi> indeed this is but the leaſt part of a Chriſtians duty, 'tis but an evidence of the loweſt degree of Charity, to retrench thoſe irregular and undue wiſhes, which oftentimes do more prejudice to our ſelves than others: If it be ſincere, it will have a further and more important influence; it will help us to govern our tongues alſo, that we may, as the great Apoſtle adviſeth us, <hi>ſpeak evil of no man,</hi> Tit. 3.2. to <hi>lay aſide all malice, and all guile and hypocriſie, and evil ſpeaking,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.1. and according to this precept did primitive Chriſtians walk.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But</hi> alas! we have degenerated in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more conſpicuouſly from their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe than in this: In place of their love, we have ſubſtituted an induſtrious ſearch into the iniquities of others, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 64.4. and have fully verified the Apoſtles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the tongue, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.8. that it is <hi>an unruly evil which no man can tame, a world of iniquity that ſets the whole creation on fire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Neither</hi> Majeſty nor innocency can now guard againſt its darts; its malignity
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:135604:25"/>reacheth through all the earth; nay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it were good if it were bounded by this. May not the Majeſty of Heaven re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that ſame complaint he expreſſeth <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Your words have been ſtout againſt me;</hi> and charge the prophane A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts of this age, <hi>for opening their mouths againſt the Heavens?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As</hi> for <hi>Innocency,</hi> although it is truely in it ſelf a ſtrong fence, yet it cannot e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape the aſſaults of a licentious tongue: but with the Pſalmiſt may complain; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, they belch out with their mouths, ſwords are in their lips,</hi> Pſal. 56.7. and I think there are few men ſo happy, who cannot with the ſame holy man regret, <hi>They lay to my charge things I know not:</hi> but how much this violates all the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of Charity, and Juſtice alſo, every mans reaſon will eaſily inſtruct him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To</hi> ſecure men from being culpable in this, it were enough onely to repreſent the meanneſs of it: but as a more noble enforcement, the Goſpel preſcribes the ſtricteſt rules againſt it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.1, 2. <hi>Judge not, that ye be not judged; for with what judgement ye judge, ye ſhall be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> A ſentence which methinks ſhould even ſtrike terrour in the conſciences of the guilty; and ſure if men would but
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:135604:25"/>minde their own concern and intereſt, they ſhould more attentively hearken to the counſel of the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.31, 32. <hi>Let all bitterneſs, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil ſpeaking, be put away from you, with all malice. And be ye kinde one to another, tender hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Chriſts ſake hath forgiven you.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>But</hi> our love muſt not conſiſt in word onely, but <hi>in deed and in truth,</hi> as the bleſſed Apoſtle exhorts the primitive Chriſtians, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18. It is a vain thing to pretend love, when we refuſe to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence it by our deeds: <hi>If a brother or ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter be naked, and deſtitute of daily food, and one of you ſay unto them, Depart in peace, be you warmed, and filled, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ye give them not thoſe things which are needful to the body, what doth it profit?</hi> Jam. 2.15, 16. We muſt make our actions and dealings the teſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may evidence our love, otherwiſe the ſincerity of it may be juſtly ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; and therefore in the firſt place we muſt actually endeavour to ſupply the wants of our indigent Brethren: This is above all things recommended to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.8. eſpecially to thoſe who have received a large allowance of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:135604:26"/>bleſſings, <hi>v.</hi> 10. and it is noted as an evidence that <hi>the love of God dwelleth not in thoſe perſons, who having this worlds goods, ſhut up their bowels of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion from thoſe that have need,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.17. Alas! little do men know how quickly the balance may change; how ſoon the richeſt may be in poverty, and ſtand in need of that ſupply that they now in the days of their plenty deny others: the inſtances to prove this, are more numerous than that they can be doubted, or need to be related.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Indeed</hi> the performance of this duty paſſeth not without a temporal reward; God, who accounts it a lending to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, hath promiſed to repay it; and ſure there cannot be better ſecurity than his promiſe. And I queſtion not but all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges can atteſt the truth of what the wiſe man obſerveth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11 24. <hi>There is that ſcattereth, and yet increaſeth; and there is that witholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I confeſs,</hi> I know no vertue more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a Chriſtian than Charity, and ſcarce any more ſcandalouſly neglected; and I am ſorry to think that thoſe good men who compaſſionate the wants of the indigent, ſhould be ſo unworthily ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:135604:26"/>as if they were but lukewarm Proteſtants, and eſtabliſhed the Popiſh Merit: but this is a piece of madneſs I ſhall rather pity than inveigh againſt; and although I be no friend to merit, yet I cannot but ſpeak honourably of thoſe whoſe charity and good works make them lovely in the ſight of God, who has accounted it <hi>pure religion and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, to viſit the fatherleſs and widows in their affliction,</hi> Jam. 1.27.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In</hi> the next place, the <hi>Chriſtian rule</hi> requires <hi>Juſtice</hi> in our intercourſe and commerce, and that in our dealings we be exactly conſcientious, according to that great rule of equity, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.12. <hi>All things whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them; for this is the law and the prophets.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice is a vice ſo mean and ignoble, that I cannot but admire how great men ſhould court it: and if men would but actuate their Reaſons, I am ſure they ſhould never become guilty of that which, if charged with, they cannot patiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, nor be reconciled with the perſons which freely reprove them. There is no man, I think, that would be ſatisfied to be called a Cheat; and is it not unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to think they ſhall evite this character who practiſe injuſtice?</p>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:135604:27"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The</hi> great bait and allurement to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, is gain and advantage; but how viſibly hath Almighty God by a wiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence defeated mens deſigns in this! <hi>There is</hi> (as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> obſerved) <hi>a fire that conſumeth the tabernacles of bribery,</hi> Job 15.34. and as the wiſe man tells us, <hi>An inheritance may be gotten haſtily at the beginning, but the end thereof ſhall not be bleſſed,</hi> Prov. 20.21.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Chriſtian rule is a moſt compendious and compleat directory to men in every ſtation and place: Parents and Children, Maſters and Servants, Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Wife may from hence learn their duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As it gives no encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Tyrants, ſo neither does it allow Rebellion in Subjects; but condemns it as a ſin heinous and unnatural. But I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand to enlarge upon every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar duty; onely I ſhall infer, that from the accompliſhment of thoſe duties enjoyned by the <hi>Chriſtian rule,</hi> is formed that <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> I would fain perſwade men to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To</hi> put a cloſe to this Chapter, it will not, I think, be amiſs to ſhew, that the Chriſtian rule of Holineſs is the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and moſt excellent that was ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant; that it far excels the Schemes of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:135604:27"/>Morality drawn by the beſt and moſt ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Maſters of Pagan Philoſophy, and is more comprehenſive and effectual to form men to true Holineſs than the Moſaical Law.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I confeſs,</hi> the Heathen Religion does not in the leaſt deſerve to be compared with the Chriſtian, no more (I may ſay, much leſs) than the light of the dimmeſt Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſhould be compared with the Sun in its brightneſs, when all miſts and clouds are diſpelled. It were indeed too great an honour to name the <hi>Alcoran</hi> with the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> the one being corrupt and imperfect, the other pure and perfect in its tendency, deſigning to make men truely vertuous and holy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If</hi> we view the rules which the beſt and moſt refined Moraliſts preſcribed, we ſhall finde much Braſs amongſt their Gold, many things exceedingly faulty, which, inſtead of forbidding, encouraged many foul Vices. Thus concerning pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards God, what unbecoming thoughts did they entertain of him? <hi>They changed</hi> (as the Apoſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> obſerves) <hi>the glory of an incorruptible God into an Image made like corruptible man,</hi> Rom. 1.23. and in thoſe moral duties that concerned themſelves and others, it
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:135604:28"/>were eaſie to ſhew how miſerably they failed. The famous Peripatetick plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the revenging of Injuries: The divine <hi>Plato</hi> allowed the community of Wives: The ſtrict <hi>Stoicks</hi> patronized the lawfulneſs of Self-murther; and thus <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing themſelves to be wiſe, they became fools.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And</hi> yet (to the ſhame of Chriſtians) how conſpicuous was the moral gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the <hi>Romans!</hi> how famous and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious are they eſteemed for their Juſtice and Conſtancy in friendſhip by all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages! their vertue did conquer reſpect and eſteem from their Enemies, and made them beloved by thoſe who fear'd their power. And here I cannot but take notice of St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the old <hi>Romans: Becauſe God</hi> (ſays he) <hi>would not beſtow Heaven upon the</hi> Romans, <hi>they being Pagans, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed the Empire of the world upon them, becauſe they were vertuous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And</hi> yet the beſt rules thoſe Illuſtrious Heroes and Law-givers taught, are not comparable to the Laws of Chriſtianity, upon theſe three accounts. <hi>Firſt,</hi> the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Law is deficient in many things, and many particular Laws mightily tend to the promoting of vice; their Law-givers
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:135604:28"/>being ignorant of the introduction of ſin, never made any precepts againſt the firſt motions to forbidden objects. <hi>Secondly,</hi> thoſe good Laws they taught, are more clearly revealed in the Goſpel, <hi>Which hath brought life and immortality to light.</hi> As the Goſpel commands onely ſuch things that are good, and forbids onely vice; ſo it more conſpicuouſly manifeſts what is good, that we may do it, and what is evil, that we may evite it. The good Laws that <hi>Epaminondas</hi> in <hi>Thebes, Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtides</hi> in <hi>Athens</hi> taught, are in the Goſpel-Oeconomy more excellently confirmed; and we are now undoubtedly ſecured, that we do well in obſerving what is commanded, and in abſtaining from what is prohibited; which <hi>Numa Pompilius, Marcus Antonius,</hi> and all the Law-givers either of <hi>Greece</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> could never be fully aſcertained of. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> we have better encouragements and inducements to obey the Goſpel-precepts, than any other Religion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes. The beſt motive to virtue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Heathens was, that <hi>vertue is a reward to it ſelf;</hi> that it is the means to be celebrated by after-ages, and ſuch-like; which were but inſignificant encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if compared with the eternal and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:135604:29"/>unſpeakably glorious reward which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity holds forth, and thoſe ſevere threatnings by which it ſecures its Laws; of which I ſhall ſpeak anon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As</hi> for the <hi>Moſaical Law,</hi> which, next to the Chriſtian, is the moſt exact and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable, there are three reaſons why it is not to be compared with, it being ſo far exceeded by the Goſpel. <hi>Firſt,</hi> the Moſaical diſpenſation is not unfitly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the great Apoſtle, <hi>A law of a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal commandment,</hi> Heb. 7.16. and <hi>A law which made nothing perfect,</hi> v. 19. but the Goſpel, which is there called <hi>the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of a better hope,</hi> is more ſpiritual and refined; and <hi>Jeſus</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>a ſurety of a better covenant,</hi> v. 22. So that we may argue as the Apoſtle in the 11th verſe of that cited Chapter doth: <hi>If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perfection were by the Levitical Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, (for under it the people received the Law) what further need was there that another Prieſt ſhould ariſe?</hi> I confeſs, the legal Sacrifices did ſhadow forth the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Chriſts; but yet I make no doubt but we may now underſtand the intent and meaning of all thoſe <hi>Types</hi> much better than they could. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the <hi>Ceremonial Law,</hi> as it was very burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, ſo did it chiefly tend to make the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:135604:29"/>obſervers thereof externally righteous, and did not ſo ſtrongly enforce the purifying of the heart. As for the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law,</hi> the Chriſtian rule as it does as ſtrictly enjoyn it, ſo it does much more powerfully excite men to the performance of it, promiſing not a temporal but a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> eternal reward. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the Moſaical diſpenſation did indulge many practices which the Chriſtian rule juſtly condemns; ſuch as Polygamy and Divorce, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Marriages allowed by no other Law: and indeed the whole contexture of the Jewiſh Religion ſeems to be onely calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late as it did well correſpond with the humour and genius of that people, and could not therefore be a general Law, agreeing with, and well attemperate to the inclinations and humours of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as the Chriſtian rule is.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Any</hi> man that ſhall compare the Jewiſh Religion with the Chriſtian, ſhall be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced that this does more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conduce to the <hi>purifying of us from all filthineſs both of the fleſh and of the ſpirit</hi> than the former; and that of all the Schemes of Religion that ever were publiſhed, none does deſerve to be paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd with Chriſtianity; nor can adopt to them that noble character the great Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:135604:30"/>gives of the Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. <hi>That it is the power of God to ſalvation.</hi>

                        <hi>AS</hi> the naked propoſal and repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of an excellent and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful object, is motive enough to excite our love, and draw out our affections to it: ſo methinks <hi>Holineſs,</hi> which of all things is the moſt noble, moſt excellent, and the moſt lovely, ſhould, even abſtracted from the conſiderations of its utility and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, conquer our eſteem, But God knows how much our depraved natures in this lapſed eſtate ſtand in need of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to excite us to our duty; and I wiſh common experience did not make it too certain, that all motives are little enough to form us to Holineſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In</hi> the former Chapters I have onely laid a foundation to this: for I thought it fit to tell men what I underſtand by <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> before I ſhould excite them to it. In this dark age of the world we want not inſtances (God knows, too many) of mens too frequent miſtaking vice for
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:135604:30"/>vertue; to prevent which errour, it was thought neceſſary to ſhew men their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and having done this, the next thing I propoſed, was to lay down ſeveral mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and inducements to engage men to the practiſe of Holineſs, founded ſolely upon this, that all thoſe endearing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that prevail with us to perform any duty or action relating to our ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar concerns, do more powerfully oblige us to be holy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This</hi> is, I confeſs, a ſubject which for its nobleneſs deſerves a better judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a more clear wit, and a more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened and quick fancy to handle it than I can pretend to: yet if I can but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with others to perfect what I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, I ſhall not think I have much miſ-em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd my time in writing this Diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This</hi> Chapter is like to be ſomewhat diſproportionable to the reſt in length, it being at firſt the onely deſigned ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to be diſcourſed on; I ſhall therefore divide it into ſeveral Sections.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>The</hi> great inclination of Mankinde to Imitation, gave ground (I doubt not)
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:135604:31"/>to that old Maxime, <hi>Plus docent exempla quàm praecepta;</hi> our depraved natures are very apt to contemn Precepts, and to court forbidden objects: The tye of a Commandment is become (by our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed guilt) too weak to binde us to our duty, &amp; is made as light of as <hi>Sampſon</hi> made of thoſe ropes with which he was bound before his locks were cut. But O what a ſecret and powerful influence have Examples on the ſpirits of men! I have ſeen Servants and Children who have contemned Commands, yet ſhamed to their duty by the Example of their Maſters and Parents. The courage and valour of a Captain, proves frequently more powerful to inſpirit inferiour Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, than the moſt forcible injunctions and helps to make even cowards ſtout; whileas a timerous Commander diſhear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens the braveſt Souldiers, and by his flight will make them who feared no danger turn their backs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Common</hi> experience makes it paſt doubt, that the patrociny and example of great men is enough to render any thing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionable. We daily have proofs of this before our eyes: nay, ſo powerful do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples ſometimes prove, that not onely the ſilly modes and geſtures of men have
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:135604:31"/>been imitated, but alſo their natural imperfections, as <hi>Nero</hi>'s wry Neck was at <hi>Rome.</hi> It is the Poets obſervation:
<q>
                              <hi>Regis ad exemplum totus componitur orbis.</hi>
                           </q> 
                           <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon</hi> which account, I heartily wiſh the Nobles and Great men of this age would illuſtrate Holineſs by their Examples; and I doubt not but contemned Holineſs ſhould be as faſhionable as they have now made Vice by their patrociny. In ſacred Writ we read, that when the Rulers of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> were religious, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Vertue, that the whole people imitated their footſteps, and worſhipped the Lord God of their Fathers: But when the Rulers became patrons of Vice, then the whole people ſacrificed in the high places, and worſhipped their Calves at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>It</hi> is indeed a caſe that well deſerves to be regretted with flouds of tears, that the footſteps of thoſe who tranſgreſs ſhould prove more efficacious and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, and have a greater influence on men, than the preſidents of good men: but more lamentable is it, that deſpiſed vertue lies like the contemned aſhes on the level, and has ſo few to raiſe up its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem by their examples.</p>
                        <pb n="52" facs="tcp:135604:32"/>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And</hi> now, ſeeing Examples have ſo much force, methinks I hear the Captain of our ſalvation ſaying, as <hi>Abimeleck</hi> ſaid to the men that were with him, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.48. <hi>Make haſte, and do as I have done.</hi> Chriſt Jeſus hath by his example taught us our duty, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15, 16. <hi>As he which hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of converſation; becauſe it is written, Be ye holy as I am holy.</hi> Upon which account we are ſeriouſly exhorted in Scripture to look unto Jeſus, and to walk as he walked; and can any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration more abundantly ſerve to inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and excite us to live holy, than this? Methinks our having ſo brave an example ſhould provoke us to follow his footſteps, <hi>who did no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>There</hi> are two chief reaſons that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevail with us to imitate other exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. <hi>Firſt,</hi> the dignity and greatneſs of the perſon. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Intereſt and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Now both theſe motives ſhould moſt powerfully prevail with us to make Chriſt the copy of our lives: For <hi>firſt,</hi> if we conſider the <hi>dignity</hi> and worth of his perſon, is he not the Son of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, who in the days of his humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>thought it no robbery to be called
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:135604:32"/>equal with God?</hi> He was not a perſon of a mean and low extraction, how meanly ſoever he lived here, but one of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary worth, who by partaking of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature elevated it to the higheſt degree of honour: He was not onely <hi>the chiefeſt among ſtten thouſands,</hi> but the delight of Heaven and Earth, before whom the Princes of the Earth muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and the great men, to give him an account of their works. And as for <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,</hi> I ſhall afterwards make it plain, that we in nothing more croſs our advantage, than in walking contrary to Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But</hi> alas! how little are we moved by this noble preſident to minde Holineſs? how ſeldom do we expreſs in our actions the vertues of our ſpiritual King? although there is nothing more rational, more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable and juſt, than to follow his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps who hath called us to his Kingdom and Glory; nothing more honourable, nor can advance our happineſs more, than to be <hi>conform to the image of Chriſt;</hi> yet in oppoſition to the moſt endearing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, we have as much ſet at nought his example, as <hi>Herod</hi> and his men of war did his perſon, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.11. Alas! what tears are ſufficient to expreſs and ſet forth this exceeding great madneſs and inſolency?</p>
                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:135604:33"/>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Methinks</hi> I hear our bleſſed Prince ſpeaking thus in his own vindication: Ye unwiſe and fooliſh ſons of men, how long will ye prefer imperfect and ignoble pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns to one that is every whit perfect and compleat? In your ſecular concerns ye judge more rationally, prove a thouſand times wiſer; for who amongſt you does not make diligent enquiry for the moſt exact pattern, that ye may conform what ye deſigne according to it? but in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of everlaſting moment, how careleſs, how negligent and fooliſh do ye prove? If I had not been held forth as the moſt deſirable copy, as a pattern moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate to your ſtate, your caſe had been more tolerable; but ſince you can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend no rational excuſe for your rejecting of me, <hi>Behold, ye deſpiſers, wonder and periſh.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I confeſs,</hi> our bleſſed Prince performed many extraordinary and miraculous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which could have no other author but one inveſted with omnipotency; and although we cannot, are not required to ſet Chriſt as our preſident in theſe, as likewiſe in many other ſpecial actions he performed, as his faſting forty days, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet even theſe we are called to admire; and muſt in ſo far imitate, as they were
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:135604:33"/>expreſſions of his great charity and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to men, and of his truſt and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy upon his Heavenly Father. But as for thoſe moral actions he performed, we are extreamly culpable if we do not make him our pattern, if we walk not as he walked: And it is ſure the moſt unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable thing that can be, to profeſs our ſelves to be his Diſciples, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the leſſons he hath copied out to us.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The</hi> whole life of Chriſt being one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued lecture of Holineſs, preſents to our view a large field to diſcourſe upon: but my intended brevity will not allow me to mention all thoſe particular actions and vertues of his, which we ought to imitate. I ſhall therefore contract my diſcourſe to thoſe more remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, wherein we ſhould induſtriouſly endeavour to imitate the holy Jeſus in his ſpirit and actions: and ſure there cannot be a more powerful motive to form us to holineſs than his moſt excellent life, which is a pattern abſolutely perfect, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned as a fair copy after which we ſhould write.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>In</hi> the firſt place, our bleſſed Leader (for ſo he is called, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.4.) hath by his precept, as well as his practice, enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:135604:34"/>us to learn meekneſs and humility of him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart.</hi> Throughout the whole courſe of his life he did evidence a ſpirit full of calmneſs and quietneſs. If we trace his foorſteps from the Cradle to the Croſs, we ſhall not fined him either by his words or actions diſcovering the leaſt expreſſion of wrath, or revenge; but the moſt admirable diſpoſition of gentleneſs and meekneſs, even then when his inſulting Enemies endeavoured to caſt upon him the moſt ignominious affronts. We read, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.3. of <hi>Moſes</hi> his great meekneſs; but how was he once and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain tranſported with paſſion! but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did our meek Jeſus, by the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable abuſes he received, ever diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a diſcompoſed ſpirit. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.7. <hi>He was oppreſſed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the ſlaughter, and as a ſheep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her ſhearers is dumb, ſo he openeth not his mouth.</hi> He did indeed frequently meet with extraordinary provocations to anger; but yet how ſweet were his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs? when the <hi>Samaritans</hi> refuſed to receive him. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.53. he did not treat them with contumelious ſpeeches, nor revenge himſelf upon them, although he
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:135604:34"/>could have done it with eaſe; but being deſired by his exaſperated Diſciples <hi>to call for fire from Heaven to conſume them,</hi> he rebuked their revengeful motion with <hi>The Son of man is not come to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them.</hi> It would be too prolix a buſineſs to inſtance the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral examples of his Gentleneſs and Meekneſs; only let us view the laſt ſcene of his life, where we ſhall behold lively inſtances to confirm this. When he did finde his three Diſciples, whom he had commanded to watch, ſleeping, he did not upbraid them for their negligence, but gently aſks them, <hi>What, could not ye watch with me one hour?</hi> and when he was treacherouſly accoaſted by his own Diſciple, who became leader to a great multitude who came out with Swords and Staves to apprehend him, with what aſtoniſhing mildneſs did he entertain this Traytor, who had the impudence to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray him with a kiſs? <hi>Friend, wherefore art thou come?</hi> Mat. 26.50. or, as another of the Evangeliſts expreſſeth it, <hi>Judas, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayeſt thou the Son of man with a kiſs?</hi> This was all the hard language he treated him with. And after he was apprehended, with what horrid contumelies and affronts
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:135604:35"/>did his barbarous Enemies entertain him? they did ſpit in his face, and buffet him; (the higheſt affronts imaginable) they ſtripped him of his ordinary cloaths, and put upon him a fools robe, and a Crown of Thorns; and being thus diſguiſed, they expoſe him to the mockery and contempt of the Spectators. Notwithſtanding of all which, he <hi>opened not his mouth;</hi> but with a moſt ſedate and ſerene temper he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived all theſe abuſes, as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> expreſſeth it, 1 Pet. 2.23. <hi>When he was reviled he reviled not again, when he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered he threatned not, but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> I confeſs, is ſo noble a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, accompanied with ſo many admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and charming advantages, that it needs (as one would think) but few words to recommend it to men; but no argument is like to prevail more with generous mindes, than the example of ſo excellent and perfect a Pattern. Sure I am, it is the moſt unaccountable thing imaginable, for the Diſciples of ſo meek a Maſter to be of a diſpoſition and temper quite oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to his.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But</hi> as his meekneſs, ſo is his <hi>humility</hi> alſo recommended to our imitation: As
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:135604:35"/>he was of a meek, ſo alſo of a lowly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. His firſt appearance upon earth was but mean and deſpicable; he was born (as the Scripture informs us) in a low eſtate, more fit for the meaneſt of his Diſciples, than for ſo great a Prince. He was not brought forth in ſome ſtately Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, nor born in a Chamber curiouſly deckt, but in a vile Stable where the bruit beaſts had their reſidence. Nay, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had diſcovered himſelf by his Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious works to be a great Prophet, the <hi>true Meſſiah who enlightneth every one that cometh into the world,</hi> yet how hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly did he walk! his Companions he did chuſe were but mean Fiſhermen; his Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation and Employment was no ways honourable; and his Revenues were but ſmall, as he himſelf did teſtifie, <hi>The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air neſts, but the Son of man hath not where he may lay his head.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Although</hi> his deſcent and extraction was incomparably great, yet he rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to conceal than to brag of it; and ſo humble was he, that he choſe rather to attribute the praiſe of his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red works to his Father, than take the honour of them to himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.28. <hi>I do nothing of my ſelf, but as my Father
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:135604:36"/>hath taught me I ſpeak theſe things.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>He</hi> was not ambitious of Rule and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but modeſtly refuſed to be a Ruler and Judge. Nay, when the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude thought to make him a King, he ſhunned their ſociety by an inviſible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval, it being quite contrary to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne in coming into the world, (as he tells us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.28.) <hi>he came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter.</hi> And to correct the inſolent pride and ambition of his followers, how did he ſtoop to waſh his Diſciples feet! a moſt admirable evidence of his lowlineſs of ſpirit.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And</hi> now ſince our great Lord and Maſter did ſo wonderfully debaſe himſelf to the form of a Servant; ſince in all his actions he did manifeſt that he was meek and lowly, how prodigiouſly incongruous is it for thoſe who profeſs themſelves to be his Diſciples to be proud and lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</p>

                           <hi>I confeſs,</hi> Humility is a grace well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming our ſtate as creatures; we are but dependent beings, having life and motion, and all thoſe endowments we are proud of, <hi>from the Father of ſpirits, from whom every good gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>
                           <hi>Humility</hi> is that peculiar grace that qualifies and fits us to receive the divine aid and aſſiſtance; as the Apoſtle St. <hi>James</hi> tells us, <hi>he gives grace to the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> Upon which account we may with the Wiſe man well conclude: <hi>Better is it to be of an humble ſpirit with the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than to divide the ſpoil with the proud,</hi> Prov. 16.19.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I doubt</hi> not but every conſidering man will finde his own Reaſon ſuggeſt a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſtore of arguments to confute the imperious aſſaults of Pride and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but methinks none can more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully prevail with ingenuous ſpirits, than the conſideration of Chriſt's humility: with this how effectually may he repel e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very temptation to pride, by ſaying, Was my Maſter lowly of ſpirit, and does it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come me to be proud?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Chriſt is alſo ſet forth as our Pattern in his ſufferings: <hi>If when ye do well</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>and ſuffer for it ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God; for even hitherto were ye cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: for Chriſt alſo ſuffered for us, leaving us an example, that we ſhould follow his

His patience under his ſufferings was very admirable: for although he was flouted and contemned by his unworthy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, was expoſed to the baſe outrages of ſcandalous ſinners, was made a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle, ſet at nought, ſpit upon, and ſmitten by unworthy worms, whom with a word he could have eaſily daſhed into nothing; in a word, though he endured all that malice could invent, ſuffered the worſt of temporal evils, and became <hi>obedient to the curſed death of the croſs;</hi> yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, how patiently did he <hi>endure the contradiction of ſinners?</hi> how entirely did he ſubmit to his Fathers Will? Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he was extreamly ſenſible of the weight of his ſufferings, yet he did not in the leaſt evidence any revengeful mind in the midſt of his extream tortures, but ſweetly recommended his ſoul into his Fathers hands. And now can any motive more effectually convince us to ſuffer pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But</hi> God knows how much we ſet at nought this preſident: fain would we enjoy a continual proſperity, a life of eaſe, without the leaſt mixture or allay of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. When we meet with any thing that imbitters our condition, like the murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:135604:37"/>
                           <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> we fret and repine, and our ſpirits begin to boil with rage and diſcontent; we cannot endure to have our pleaſures impaired, but <hi>Jonah</hi>-like we are diſcontented, and ready to ſay, <hi>we do well to be angry:</hi> we aggravate the moſt minute trouble with imagined cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and are ready to ſay, <hi>Come, behold and ſee if there be any affliction like mine.</hi> And although we are aſſured that our repinings cannot remove or ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten our burthen, cannot give us the leaſt eaſe or relief; yet we never reſt till thoſe puddled ſtreams be ſtirred up. Our grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings are almoſt inſeparable concomitants of our ſufferings; and if our Father ſmite us, we begin to accuſe his love and tenderneſs, notwithſtanding he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed us that <hi>whom he loveth he chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>If</hi> we meet with reproaches, our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge is on the wing; the leaſt affront kindles this unſanctified fire: No argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments can tame our Fury; no preſident proves effectual to form our Souls to true patience. If we drink of the waters of <hi>Marah,</hi> we complain of their bitterneſs, &amp;, like fooliſh Children, think we are hardly dealt with.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And</hi> although impatience enflames ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:135604:38"/>than allays the diſtemper, though it augments the degrees of our trouble, and diſenables us to bear the ſtroke of Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; yet we will not be perſwaded to a calm and quiet ſubmiſſion to the Divine Will. Though impatience exaſperates the pain, yet we think we do well to be angry. If we meet with injuries, our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite of revenge is ſtirred up; <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>bloud</hi> we ſay cannot <hi>endure</hi> ſuch <hi>affronts;</hi> we imagine it ſtains our Reputation and Honour in the world, and is degenerous and ſervile.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thus</hi> do we ſew Fig-leaves to cover our nakedneſs; but the all-ſeeing God knows that all theſe repinings are arrows directed againſt his Providence; otherwiſe we ſhould with the Royal Pſalmiſt ſay, <hi>I will not open my mouth, for thou didſt it.</hi> To this impregnable Fortreſs he had his recourſe, when cauſleſly curſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled by <hi>Shimei:</hi> it was this that ſilenced old <hi>Eli, It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good:</hi> he durſt not quarrel at the meſſage, but quietly he ſubmits. There is a ſecret Providence which doth over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule the moſt terrible accidents, and is not accountable to humane Reaſon. All thoſe calamities and ſufferings we undergo, are ordered by infinite Counſel; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:135604:38"/>at ſuch diſpenſations, we indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blame Almighty Goodneſs and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Is</hi> it fit and congruous that God ſhould take meaſures from men in his Oeconomy of the World? is it reaſonable that the whole courſe of things ſhould be put out of order, to ſatisfie every private mans hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor? can there be any greater madneſs, than to preſcribe rules of Government to infinite Wiſdom? Why then are we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied with our adverſe ſtate? why do we repine and complain?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>If</hi> we did indeed compare our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies with our Sufferings, our Receipts with our Merits, or our Condition with that of ſome others, we could not but be convinced of our folly: but we ſtill pore upon the ſore; all our thoughts are taken up and in exerciſe about our affliction: if we would deal rationally, let us view the ſufferings of our bleſſed Redeemer, and ſee if we dare make a contrary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion to that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Foraſmuch then as Chriſt hath ſuffered for us in the fleſh,</hi> let us <hi>arm</hi> our <hi>ſelves like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with the ſame mind:</hi> He ſuffered patiently and calmly for us; and it is but reaſonable that Servants imitate their Maſter, and ſuffer the diſaſters they meet
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:135604:39"/>with, with the ſame <hi>mind</hi> that he did; that being thus made conform to our head, we may be alſo partakers with him of his joy.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>'Tis</hi> indeed an unchild-like behaviour, to quarrel at the diſpenſations of our Heavenly Father: Alas! all we merit by our ſins, is ſtripes and chaſtiſements; and <hi>it is of the Lords mercy that we are not conſumed:</hi> ſure many who have offended leſs, have been juſtly ſent to <hi>everlaſting burnings,</hi> do now <hi>dwell with devouring flames;</hi> and <hi>why ſhould a living man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain?</hi> it were certainly more rational to be humbled for the evil that occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the rod, that our preſent miſery may not be the prelude to more laſting tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Nay, there is nothing that more offends God, that is more contrary to the pattern ſet before us, than to murmur and repine; let us therefore ſtudy to bear the reſemblance of our eldeſt Brother, that our Heavenly Father may acknowledge us for his Children.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>In</hi> the next place, Chriſt's <hi>obedience</hi> to the Will of his Father, is ſet forth as our preſident; and can any thing more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully perſwade us to <hi>obedience</hi> than his <hi>example?</hi> which not onely diſcovers our duty, but alſo inſpirits and enables us to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:135604:39"/>perform it. If the marvelous pattern of Chriſt's entire obedience does not form our wills to do what God enjoyns, I ſcarce know any argument that will prove <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

He was, as the great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells us, <hi>Obedient to the death of the Croſs,</hi> ſubmitted to the moſt dreadful ſufferings, that he might inſtruct us <hi>to keep his commandments, even as he kept his Fathers commandments,</hi> Joh. 15.10. and <hi>that the ſame mind be in us that was in him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But</hi> God knows how little we regard either his Precepts or Examples: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our great Maſter has made his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:135604:40"/>our rule, yet how ready are we to deſpiſe it, if in the leaſt it croſs our humors or carnal intereſt? Alas! little do we conſider, that obedience is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially neceſſary in order to our ſupream happineſs; and that torments, as ſevere and intolerable as they are laſting, are the lot of the diſobedient.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>It</hi> were to be wiſhed that the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> would but ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ponder what they will be able to ſay in the great day of Audit. Sure I am, the whole Contexture and Harmony of the divine Precepts and Doctrines are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable and juſt, and therefore call for our hearty compliance with them. The wiſe God never iſſued out any Command which could not be obeyed; He is not like the <hi>Aegyptian Task-maſters,</hi> to require <hi>Brick while there is no Straw.</hi> Nay, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, our duty and intereſt are coupled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo cloſely, that if we diſobey and rebel, we may thank our ſelves for the miſery we have choſen.</p>

                           <hi>And</hi> as his obedience is ſet before us for imitation, ſo is his <hi>Love, Charity,</hi> and <hi>Compaſſion</hi> alſo.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:135604:40"/>odds with Heaven, and incapable to help our ſelves, then, even then, did he commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerate our caſe, and by his <hi>own Blood</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled us to the Father. It is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt demonſtration of love imaginable, for <hi>a man to lay down his life for his friend,</hi> Joh. 15.13. and yet more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful was the love of our Redeemer in paſſing through ſo many cruel ſufferings for us, who were but Rebels and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. O how ſhould the remembrance of his boundleſs compaſſions tranſport and raviſh us with love! how ſtrange is it, that the higheſt endearments of Love have not inflamed our ſpirits, and made Love mutual and reciprocal!</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Love</hi> is a moſt excellent affection, of a noble original, by which we reſemble the beſt of beings; the great God being by the beloved Diſciple deſcribed to be <hi>Love:</hi> and indeed well does this deſcription ſute with his dealings with men.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:135604:42"/>primitive Chriſtians. It is a great miſtake to think we are commanded to a rigorous and ſtrict converſation which cannot be attained; the faithful in former ages have run the ſame race that is ſet before us; they have fully enough cleared the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of our duty: <hi>Wherefore ſeeing we alſo</hi> (as the Apoſtle argues) <hi>are compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed about with ſo great a cloud of witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, let us lay aſide every weight, and the ſin that doth ſo eaſily beſet us, and let us run with patience the race that is ſet before us,</hi> Heb. 12.1.

                           <hi>But</hi> not to digreſs; that which I am now to urge, is: ſince happineſs is that which excites men to perform any thing chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in order to the attaining of it, how mightily ſhould the expectation of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture felicity induce them to the practice of Holineſs? for betwixt the two our bleſſed Saviour has made an inſeparable connexion, Matth. 5.8. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in ſpirit, for they ſhall ſee God:</hi> and indeed it is the height of folly and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for impure wretches to expect they ſhall be partakers of <hi>the inheritance of the Saints of light;</hi> for as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>There ſhall in no wiſe enter into it any thing that defileth,</hi> Rev. 21.27. Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the eſtabliſhed condition of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Without holineſs no man ſhall ſee God.</hi> Hence is it that all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes concerning our future felicity are onely made to thoſe men who <hi>purifie themſelves from all filthineſs of the fleſh and ſpirit;</hi> and the great deſign of them is to encourage us to Holineſs; upon which account St. <hi>Paul</hi> draws a very preſſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Having therefore theſe promiſes,</hi> (of which he ſpake in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapter) <hi>let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of the fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of God.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>There</hi> is nothing more certain, than that onely holy ſouls are in a capacity of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating of that future felicity; and theſe may without the leaſt charge of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption claim an intereſt in it: But for thoſe vitious wretches, who are wholly polluted, who have devoted themſelves to commit ſin with greedineſs, and take pleaſure in doing evil; how utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable are they (if they continue ſuch) to dwell in his preſence, <hi>who is not a God that taketh pleaſure in wickedneſs?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And</hi> now ſeeing there is ſuch an inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable connexion between Happineſs and Holineſs, it cannot be amiſs if we take a ſhort view of the excellency of this coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial felicity, that it may more plainly appear what a notable encouragement and motive it is to holineſs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>There</hi> be two things that forcibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the excellency of that future ſtate of bliſs. <hi>Firſt,</hi> A perfect freedom and immunity from all evils. And <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> a perpetual enjoyment of the chief good.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> it is a bleſſedneſs wholly exempt from evils whether of ſenſe or loſs; 'tis a happineſs attended with no inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, nor diſmal circumſtances, as the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt ſtate here is: we now walk in the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:135604:44"/>midſt of perplexing doubts and fears; temptations increaſe our inquietudes, and dangers our continual fears: our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints are by far more numerous than our joys; nay, what is our whole life, but a ſcene where ſorrow and fears act their parts! <hi>Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of evil.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But</hi> our future bleſſedneſs quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all thoſe evils; there is nothing admitted to imbitter that pleaſant ſtate, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.4. <hi>And God ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there ſhall be no more death, neither ſorrow, nor crying, neither ſhall there be any more pain; for the former things are paſſed away.</hi> The holy ſoul ſhall then no more complain of any dolorous hours; the heavenly <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> is a place unacquainted with every thing that is uneaſie and troubleſome.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And</hi> yet this is but the leaſt part of the Saints felicity: for as they ſhall enjoy a perfect freedom from evil, ſo ſhall they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be advanced to the fulleſt fruition of that God, where all the ſtreams of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs do finally empty themſelves: <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in ſpirit, for they ſhall ſee God,</hi> Matth. 5.8. They ſhall ſee him, not as now <hi>through a Glaſs darkly,</hi> but then <hi>face to face,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.12. they ſhall, as
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:135604:45"/>the <hi>Angels in Heaven, always behold the face of their Father,</hi> Matth. 18.10. in whoſe <hi>preſence</hi> (as the Pſalmiſt aſſures us) <hi>is fulneſs of joy, and at whoſe right hand are pleaſures for evermore,</hi> Pſal. 16.11. O the unſpeakable delectability of the Saints future ſtate! where the moſt bleſſed God ſhines forth in his Glory, where the beams of beauty raviſh the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, who ſtand continually in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence receiving the manifeſtations of his Glory!</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sure</hi> if the faint expectation of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the company of vertuous men in their fancied <hi>Elyzium,</hi> did inſtigate ſome Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens to imitate their vertues; how much more perſwaſive ſhould the heavenly <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and the City of the living God be? where the holy Soul ſhall be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to converſe with an innumerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of holy Angels, and taken into the bleſſed Society and Church of the firſt-born; where all thoſe imperfections that imbitter our communion here, are remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; where the holy Soul ſhall ſee <hi>Jeſus the</hi> bleſſed <hi>Mediator of the new Covenant, Heb.</hi> 12. who ſuffered ſo much for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, now ſitting in glory and majeſty; not crowned (as once he was) with <hi>thorns,</hi> nor wearing a <hi>purple robe;</hi> but having on
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:135604:45"/>his head the moſt tranſplendent Diadem, and cloathed with Majeſty and Beauty. Methinks the thoughts of beholding this glory, and participating of ſo much feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, ſhould excite the moſt lazie to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Holineſs, and to walk worthy of him who hath called us to his Kingdom and glory.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But</hi> I confeſs I am not able to expreſs half of the glory of that future felicity: The bleſſed Apoſtle ſeems to intimate, that all Hyperbolical expreſſions fall ſhort in deſcribing it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. where he ſtiles it, <hi>A far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory:</hi> and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. he tells us, <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath it entred into the heart of man to conceive what God hath prepared for thoſe that love him.</hi> For although we may be aſſured that the reward is of infinite value, and that <hi>the righteous ſhall ſhine forth as the ſun in the kingdom of their Father:</hi> yet the moſt glorious part is hid from the eyes of viators; 'tis onely thoſe who taſte the Honey-comb that can beſt diſcover its ſweetneſs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And</hi> yet it is prodigiouſly ſtrange, that the imperfect glance of future Glory that men may here behold, is ſo ineffectual to form them to Holineſs; that men who
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:135604:46"/>know they may be for ever happy, if they would ſtudy and endeavour to be holy in all manner of converſation, yet live as if they thought ſuch a happy ſtate not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be noticed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I confeſs,</hi> if the faithful and true God had not promiſed this ſtate of bleſſedneſs, and diſcovered by revelation the truth and reality of it, we could never have drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of partaking of ſo much happineſs. The Heathen world could never be aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained (by Natures dim light) that the Soul is beyond all doubt immortal, and that there is a future ſtate of rewards and puniſhments. The wiſeſt of their Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, by their moſt laborious ſearch, were exceedingly confuſed in their thoughts about it, and could at the moſt only entertain ſome probable gueſſes and conjectures, founded upon moral argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which could never perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer their doubts: They did indeed think it was very reaſonable to believe that God (who is holy, juſt, and good) would in another life (ſince he did it not in this) reward good men, and puniſh the bad; but they could not be, beyond all doubt, aſcertained that it would be ſo. The moſt celebrated <hi>Socrates,</hi> who parted with this life in expectation of a better, plainly told
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:135604:46"/>his Friends, it was God onely who knew whether there were a future felicity or not; much leſs could either he or any other, without revelation, diſcover the nature and quality of the bleſſedneſs of that future ſtate. And indeed, although they entertained ſome imperfect notions of a future life of bliſs for the Soul, yet they never thought of the reſurrection of the Body: although 'tis true, the felicity they formed, was more congruous by far to ſatisfie ſenſual appetites, than rational Souls: The Poets <hi>Elyzium</hi> being much of the ſame nature with the <hi>Mahometan Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe,</hi> exactly accommodated to their fleſh and ſenſes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>In</hi> theſe thick clouds of darkneſs and ignorance did the wiſeſt of the Heathens walk: Exceedingly perplexed they were what to think, their doubts being greater than their hopes. But the ariſing of the <hi>Sunſhine of Righteouſneſs</hi> hath wholly diſpelled all that darkneſs; the Goſpel hath <hi>brought life and immortality to light,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.10. and hath undoubtedly aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us that there is a reward for the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and that Holineſs ſhall be crowned with Happineſs.</p>

All which phraſes do moſt ſignificantly expreſs the ſeverity and intolerableneſs of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: for what puniſhment is ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as that of <hi>Fire?</hi> and how unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably does it inhance the miſery, in that it is <hi>eternal?</hi> and that too, as inflicted by an offended God, who is executing his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon ſinners.</p>

This the Apoſtle plainly enough holds forth, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. <hi>He gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and puriſie unto himſelf a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people zealous of good works.</hi> Now what argument ſhould be ſo powerful and prevalent to engage Chriſtians to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally holy, as the due conſideration of Chriſt's redeeming them for that end?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Men</hi> who are endu'd with any ſparks of ingenuity, cannot but be inſpirited to be ſeparate from the pollutions of this world, when they reflect what their Redeemer hath ſuffered in order to the purchaſing of their pardon and reconciliation: For when poor Man had caſt himſelf headlong from Heaven to Earth, had loſt his priſtine purity, and ſubjugated himſelf to the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el tyranny and dominion of ſin; in this deplorable ſtate being utterly unable to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:135604:51"/>help himſelf, our bleſſed Lord redeemed us from our captivity, by offering up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a ranſom to ſatisfie divine Juſtice; and all this, that we might walk in new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life. And now what ingratitude is it to deſpiſe ſo much love? Sure, <hi>If he that deſpiſed Moſes law died without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, of how much ſorer puniſhment ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot the Son of God, and hath counted the Bloud of the Covenant wherewith he was ſanctified an unholy thing?</hi> Heb. 10.28, 29.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>He</hi> muſt certainly be of a very baſe and diſingenous ſpirit, who takes pleaſure in ſin, when he conſiders how dearly Chriſt paid for it. Hath he been at ſo much pains, undergone ſuch diſmal ſufferings to purchaſe our peace, and will we not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding fruſtrate his deſigne? how ſtrange to aſtoniſhment is this, that men ſhould prefer captivity to freedom!</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Alas!</hi> is it not enough that our bleſſed Maſter was ſo barbarouſly and deſpiteful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed by the Jews and Roman Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, but muſt we be alſo Actors in the Tragedy, and by our ſins crucifie him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Did</hi> he not die that we might live? and ſhall we ſpend our life in offering
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:135604:51"/>deſpite unto him? Strange, that ſo much madneſs ſhould lodg in the breaſts of any into whom God hath breathed the breath of life!</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I might</hi> here alſo adde, that it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning, and offering of the greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite to the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> to deſpiſe Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: for upon this account is the third perſon of the bleſſed Trinity called <hi>the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> becauſe his peculiar office is to enable us to perform holy actions: now if we continue in our rebellion, if we reject the offers of grace, and the internal motions of the Spirit to Holineſs, we do hereby become guilty of quenching the Spirit of God, and offering deſpite unto him; which is ſo horrid a piece of villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that Heaven threatens it with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt torments.</p>

                           <hi>Of</hi> all outward and temporal bleſſings, <hi>length of days</hi> hath juſtly the precedency, ſince without this, all others can afford little or no comfort: The poſſeſſion and enjoyment of other mercies, can beſtow no ſatisfaction to men lying on their beds
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:135604:52"/>of languiſhing: nay, there is no comfort, be it never ſo great, but men would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly quit with, to acquire this. Now ſince this is above all things ſo univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſired, it cannot but very much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance the value of Holineſs, to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that there is nothing ſo proper, nor more effectual to procure length of days than this.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>In</hi> order to my proving of this, I ſhall firſt make it plain from Scripture, that length of days is due to holy men by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the many true and faithful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; and ſecondly, I ſhall appeal to common experience to determine the caſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> there is nothing more evidently aſſerted in Scripture, than that Holineſs hath the promiſe of length of days an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>My ſon, forget not my law, but let thine heart keep my commandments; for length of days and long life ſhall they adde unto thee.</hi> This encouraging motive is preſſed very effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually by <hi>Moſes,</hi> in his exhortation to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.40. <hi>Thou ſhalt keep therefore his ſtatutes and his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou maiſt
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:135604:52"/>prolong thy days upon the earth.</hi> Upon this account we alſo finde that there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny promiſes of this nature to obedient Children, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.12. <hi>Honour thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And</hi> as <hi>Righteouſneſs tendeth to life,</hi> (as the Wiſe man obſerves) ſo <hi>he that purſueth evil purſueth it to his own death,</hi> Prov. 11.19. There is nothing more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from Scripture, than that ſin hath a natural tendency to ſhorten mens lives; nay, the great God, who is ſerious in his threatnings, hath aſſured us it is ſo: upon which account we may well conclude with the Wiſe man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.27. <hi>The years of the wicked ſhall be ſhortned.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The</hi> whole tenour of the Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with many ſuch promiſes and threatnings; and the thing is ſo plain, that I need not ſtand to tranſcribe many texts.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But</hi> beſides Scripture, this truth is alſo plainly atteſted by common experience: for if we examine who are the men who for ordinary are moſt obnoxious to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, and live ſhorteſt; we ſhall finde it true enough, that the vitious are the men, <hi>who live not out half their days,</hi>
                           <pb n="94" facs="tcp:135604:53"/>Prov. 23.29, 30. <hi>Who hath woe? who hath ſorrow? who hath wounds without cauſe? they that tarry long at the wine,</hi> &amp;c. Holineſs is repugnant and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with exceſs, which naturally puts a period to the lives of men: It forbids all manner of vice, which <hi>leads down to the chambers of death;</hi> and keeps men within due bounds in their eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Before</hi> mankind had corrupted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their notorious and impudent vitiouſneſs, we read of their great length of days; but the increaſe of ſin multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied diſeaſes, which hurry men to untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deaths.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I deny</hi> not but the great Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Univerſe may, for holy and wiſe ends known unto himſelf, cut ſhort the lives of the righteous; yet ſurely if we conſult either Experience or Reaſon, we ſhall finde it certain beyond doubt, that vertuous men enjoy, for ordinary, far the longeſt lives.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Some</hi> good men may be naturally of a brittle conſtitution, yet how ſtrangely has their life been protracted by their mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and ſobriety? and how many ſtrong men have had their days ſhortened by their intemperance and exceſs?</p>
                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:135604:53"/>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Indeed,</hi> he that conſiders this well, ſhall finde, that Holineſs is the moſt effectual means to promote long life, both upon a moral and natural account. Upon a <hi>moral</hi> account, long life is the reward which the divine promiſes do ſecure to ſuch men; and on the contrary, wickedneſs is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſhortneſs of days. Upon a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> account, the fire doth not more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally produce heat, than Holineſs does procure health and length of days; and there is nothing more evident, than that the moſt of vices have a phyſical effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the ſhortning of humane life. That this is the neceſſary product and genuine effect of intemperance and laſciviouſneſs, needs no other argument to prove it, but the daily examples of multitudes, whom thoſe ſins have hurried to their graves. And truly there is not any vice which does not like fire in mens boſoms torture and conſume them; and ſo diſorders and diſcompoſes them, that they even neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the neceſſary means of their health.

                           <hi>How</hi> many brave and gallant actions have been performed, which if they had wanted the bait of Honour had never been attempted! Gallant ſouls, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe all other rewards, have been hereby excited to undergo the greateſt dangers.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Now,</hi> ſince honour is ſo highly eſteemed, eſpecially by thoſe who pretend to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſitie; I ſhall, to encourage ſuch to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend Holineſs, endeavour to prove, that the moſt effectual means to procure Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and to be in eſteem both with God and man, is <hi>to live</hi> (as the Apoſtle advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth men) <hi>ſoberly, righteouſly, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Onely</hi> before I proceed to prove this, I ſhall premiſe one Caution, namely, that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:135604:54"/>by <hi>Honour</hi> I do not chiefly underſtand one dignified with any extrinſecal honour ariſing either from his Birth or Office; though both theſe are to be highly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, and muſt not be denied that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal reſpect due unto them: but by <hi>Honour</hi> I underſtand that eſteem and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation that the beſt and wiſeſt men do give to any whoſe Moral honour is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous; and under this notion the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick-Moraliſt hath very well expreſſed it,
<q>
                              <hi>Nobilitas ſola est atque unica virtus.</hi>
                           </q> which upon the matter diſagrees not much from that ſacred poſition of the Wiſe man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.1. <hi>A good name is rather to be choſen than great riches.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Having</hi> premiſed this, I come now to prove that Holineſs is the path-way to Honour. And indeed, this is ſo plainly aſſerted in Scripture, that it is needleſs to inſiſt. The God of Heaven hath aſſured us, that thoſe that <hi>Honour him, he will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and thoſe that deſpiſe him ſhall be lightly eſteemed,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.30. Much like to this, is that inducement to Holineſs urged by our Lord Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.26. <hi>If any man ſerve me, him will my Father honour.</hi> Now men cannot honour God
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:135604:55"/>more, than by being holy: for the word is comprehenſive, and includes all thoſe duties that God hath enjoyned; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very vice is a deſpiſing of his ſacred Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. If then holy men are thoſe onely whom God will honour, and vitious men thoſe whom he will contemn, we may eaſily conclude, who are the honourable, and who are the baſe and ignoble. Sure thoſe men muſt be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, whom the Fountain of Honour e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteems ſuch.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>'Tis</hi> upon this account that the Saints are called (in Scripture) <hi>the excellent of the earth,</hi> and <hi>the worthies of the world,</hi> (how meanly ſoever men eſteem them) <hi>of whom the world is not worthy:</hi> And the righteous is ſaid to be <hi>more excellent than his neighbour.</hi> And indeed, Holineſs doth not only promote the honour and eſteem of private perſons, but of publick Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and Kingdoms alſo, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.34. <hi>Righteouſneſs exalteth a nation; but ſin is a reproach to any people.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>This</hi> is a truth which the wiſeſt of the Heathens, who yet wanted Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conſtantly taught, namely, That <hi>Honour is the reward of vertue.</hi> Hence the large Lectures they have written in the commendation thereof: it would be too
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:135604:55"/>tedious to tranſcribe even the Elogies that they have written in the praiſe of Vertue; and indeed it is well worthy of our obſervation, that as they have illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated Vertue by their large Encomiums of it, ſo Vertue (which they courted) hath made them venerable to poſterity, and tranſmitted to us their memories un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the moſt amiable Encomiums imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: And however their birth was but mean and almoſt regardleſs, yet their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues have made them more famous than Princes and Emperours. The vertues of <hi>Ariſtides, Socrates, Seneca, Marcus Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus,</hi> and many others, have made their renown glorious; whileas many Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and great men have had their names buried in ſilence.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Let</hi> a man be as rich as ever any of <hi>Adam</hi>'s poſterity was, or (that I may extend it farther) as high as his ambitious thoughts can wiſh; let him be wiſe as <hi>Solomon,</hi> and endued with all other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and advantages; yet if he want vertue, how inſipid will his Name be to poſterity? It is Vertue alone that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth to ſame. 'Tis true, ſome wicked men (called in Scripture vile, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their authority) have been ſet in high places, and honoured for fear,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:135604:56"/>when alive; yet they never received that honour which hath in all ages accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied the Righteous. They have had the external, (which is indeed due to men by vertue of their Deſcent or Office) but wanted that internal reverence and honour which is onely due to good men: and I doubt not to ſay, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more incongruous and unſuitable, than to ſee Honour given to ſuch men. <hi>As ſnow in ſummer, and as rain in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt; ſo honour is not ſeemly for a fool,</hi> Prov. 26.1.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Vice</hi> is in the judgement of all conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering men ſo mean and baſe, that it caſts a ſtain and reproach upon men; makes their names unſavory, and ſtink in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils of after-ages: but Holineſs forces a veneration from men, and makes poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity raiſe Elogies in their memory; <hi>but the memory of the wicked ſhall be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Virtue</hi> was that alone whereby many Kingdoms and Empires have been raiſed; was that which made them ſo flouriſhing and potent, and prevailed more to their eſtabliſhment and advancement, than Strength or Policy. Thus it was with the old <hi>Romans,</hi> (for their virtues are a ſhame to the preſent ſtate of that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire)
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:135604:56"/>their Clemencie and Juſtice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Kingdomes, and made <hi>Rome</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned and glorious beyond all other Kingdoms and Commonwealths: and as Vertue hath raiſed <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> ſo hath it alſo particular <hi>Perſons;</hi> whileas Vice hath caſt Emperours from their Thrones, and made them as unfortunate as they were wicked.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Many</hi> of the primitive Martyrs, who were renowned by Kingdoms and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths (who keep Feſtivals in honour of their memories) were but of an inferiour degree, and had nothing to recommend them to poſterity but their Holineſs and Sanctity; and indeed, any man that conſults Reaſon, will eaſily finde himſelf conſtrained to reverence and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem virtuous men.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>'Tis</hi> a wonder that any man who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to generoſity ſhould be vitious, there being nothing ſo mean and baſe as Vice, which like to cowards always lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, and dares not approach the light. I doubt not but this preſent age hath ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at as high a confidence in proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming their ſins as <hi>Sodom,</hi> as ever any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer age acquired; and it may (to the reproach of it) be ſaid, as ever any is like to reach to: yet till men caſt quite
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:135604:57"/>off humanity, it cannot be expected that Vice ſhall have Advocates to plead in its defence. 'Tis a noble ſaying of the great Moraliſt <hi>Seneca; Licet Deus neſciret nec homo puniret peccatum, non tamen pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem ob peccati vilitatem.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>'Tis</hi> no wonder then though Vice ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear (as the Devil in <hi>Samuel</hi>'s mantle) under the cloak of Vertue; though Luſt maſk it ſelf with the pretence of Love, and Cruelty of Zeal: but by this means it proclaims its timorouſneſs, not daring to own publickly what it really is.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>It</hi> were a large field, to deſcend to the conſideration of every particular vertue and vice, and to ſhew that there is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vertue but tends to the advancement of a mans honour and fame, and no vice which is not ungentile, mean, and baſe: But the brevity I have deſigned will not allow me to enlarge; only in brief I ſhall demonſtrate the truth of this by ſome few Inſtances.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Juſtice</hi> is ſo gallant a vertue, that it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced the renown of thoſe whom it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned, beyond what riches or preferment could ever beſtow. The <hi>Romans</hi> were more famous, and (where they were E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies) more formidable for their Juſtice than their Power: it was this vertue
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:135604:57"/>which in a peculiar manner made Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters and Kingdoms ſubmit to their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments. But <hi>Injuſtice</hi> is ſo baſe and contemptible a vice, that it hath made thoſe who are captivated by it, deſpiſed as the unworthieſt of men, not deſerving to be taken into frendſhip, but to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from humane Societies. How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavory hath the name of unjuſt Judges been to poſterity, while every one is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſtrew ſome Elogies in honour of the juſt!</p>

                           <hi>To</hi> this I may annex <hi>Conſtancy in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> as a vertue as noble as amiable: For who will not admire and celebrate the man who remains fixt to his friend, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever alterations or changes there may be in his condition? And ſure whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fails in his friendſhip, lays himſelf o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the moſt mercileſs condition, and needs expect to be left to befriend himſelf when the wheel of Providence laies him below thoſe he thought unworthy of his favour.</p>

                           <hi>Of</hi> all vertues, Liberality, Charity, and Compaſſion are ſo noble, that common ſpeech adapts this Elogie to them by way of emphaſis; and indeed, I think I need not ſay much to raiſe an eſtimate of theſe: for no man can be ſo baſe as to deſpiſe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:135604:58"/>thoſe who beſtow favours upon him. Sure there is no vertue that makes men more famous, that wins the hearts and affections of people more, than Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: but <hi>Avarice</hi> is ungentile and ſordid; and ſo odious a vice, that it ever leſſens all other vertues, and makes thoſe it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes the moſt hateful of men.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Charity</hi> is an obliging virtue; and as it hath its original from, ſo doth it alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily produce Love, and eſteem too: he who prefers the neceſſities of others before his own ſuperfluities, and who does ſupply the wants of others, does ſo chear the languiſhing hearts of the needy, that nothing can be more generous, nor generally meets with a greater recompence of honour and eſteem.</p>

                           <hi>To</hi> compaſſionate the caſe of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs, of the Poor and Needy, is ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a vertue, that the Apoſtle makes this qualification alone the evidence of <hi>pure and undefiled religion.</hi> It is a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and more than bruitiſh ſin, to ſlight and forget ſuch.</p>

                           <hi>Meekneſs</hi> and <hi>Humility</hi> are ſuch noble embelliſhments of humane nature, as I have formerly ſhewed, that none but proud and inſolent ſpirits, who have been always condemned as inſufferable, durſt ever diſeſteem them.</p>

Perſons of a noble education and original, are frequently known by their condeſcending and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging behaviour; and I am ſure Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Eſteem are the apparent effects of Courteſie.</p>

                           <hi>Temperance</hi> and <hi>Moderation</hi> are ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues more noble than that they need elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to advance their value, as its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries are too mean and beaſtly to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed againſt. How bruitiſh and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible is a drunken man, who is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an object of pity, (as mad-men are) than reproach! who being a more apt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of a beaſt than a man, deſerves as little Honour, as he is ignorant what Honour means.</p>

                           <hi>In</hi> all things that concern practice, there is ſcarce any motive more forcible than Pleaſure; and of all pleaſures, thoſe that entertain the Soul are the moſt excellent. We indeed need no argument but expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, to demonſtrate how raviſhing ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual pleaſures and delights are, how much they are careſſed and courted, till men be glutted and filled with them. But alas! how inconſiderable are all ſenſitive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights? the enjoyment of theſe cannot raiſe us above <hi>the beaſts that periſh;</hi> but thoſe pleaſures which are fitted for the rational nature, are noble and laſting; and ſuch are all thoſe delights that ariſe from a holy converſation; no joy, without this, being able to make a mans life pleaſant and delightful.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>There</hi> is in Holineſs an internal delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, that is better felt, than it can be expreſſed; but how loathſome and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious is Vice? it is compared in Scripture to the moſt ugly and unpleaſant things: But Holineſs is ſo comely, ſo delightful, and raviſhing, that it is very fitly (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:135604:59"/>to the Scripture-Epithet of it) called, <hi>the Beauty of Holineſs.</hi> It is this alone that produces a calm and ſerene Conſcience; from which neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults acquieſcence and delight: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, this is no fantaſtick and imaginary joy, (as the Atheiſts of this Age would make men believe) but a true and real one, affording much more complacency and ſatisfaction, than all the pleaſures of ſenſe. To the truth of which, I doubt not but thoſe men who queſtion it ſhould aſſent, if they would but make the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment; and till they do this, they give us too evident an inſtance of their folly, in denying the reality of thoſe raptures of joy reſulting from a holy converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But</hi> beſides Experience, this truth is likewiſe confirmed by Reaſon: For who is in more probable circumſtances to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of Pleaſures, than he who is Maſter of his Paſſions, who hath ſubdued his appetites, and freed himſelf from thoſe imperious Lords, who denied him the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of taſting and reliſhing pleaſures? The pious Soul may have no large allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of temporal mercies; yet having Contentment, he is richer than the wicked man whoſe coffers are full.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>But</hi> we need not doubt of the reality of thoſe pleaſures; the Wiſe man hath long ſince put this out of queſtion, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Her ways are ways of pleaſantneſs.</hi> There is here a concurrence of all thoſe circumſtances that contribute to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing delectable: 'tis a way pleaſant for its plainneſs, and deſirable for its end. There is not indeed any thing wanting in it, that uſually draws out mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>All</hi> beauty falls inconceivably ſhort of this; it being Holineſs alone, that makes the righteous <hi>ſhine forth as the ſun in the Kingdom of their Father:</hi> without this, all natural comelineſs is imperfect, and, as the Wiſe man expreſſes it, <hi>is deceitful and vain,</hi> Prov. 31.30.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And</hi> yet what an univerſal Empreſs is external beauty become? nothing being of equal force to attract the eye of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders as it doth.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Now</hi> if Beauty mixed with ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, accompanied with ſo much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance and ſlavery, be ſo enchanting

                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Alas!</hi> all earthly beauty will be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid in the duſt! a little time will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face the faireſt face, and make its beauty conſume like a Moth: an unexpected ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident may disfigure it, and marre the moſt lovely features; and there is no doubt but old Age, which draws on a pace, will make wrinkles in the ſmootheſt face, and make it wither as a flower: But the Beauty of Holineſs is laſting; it fades not with time, nor can it be impaired by the moſt loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and nauſeating diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Since</hi> then Pleaſure is ſo ready to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite our affections, and draw out our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency, 'tis pity that the nobleſt, the moſt ſatisfying, and the moſt laſting ſhould be ſo much contemned. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.10. <hi>He that loveth ſilver, ſhall not be ſatisfied with ſilver; nor he that loveth abundance, with increaſe.</hi> All the careſſes of this World are unable to ſatisfie the Soul; but how raviſhing are the joys of a holy converſation! The pleaſures of this world
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:135604:61"/>are ſhort and momentary, are onely (as the Apoſtle phraſeth them) for a <hi>ſeaſon,</hi> which quickly paſſeth; but the joy of the Holy Ghoſt is as laſting as unſpeakable; and <hi>this joy</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples) <hi>no man ſhall take from you.</hi> It is without the reach of the malice of men and Devils too.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Alas!</hi> how diminutive does it make the pleaſures of the wicked, to ſay they are ſhort? how exceedingly does this one circumſtance diminiſh them? But indeed this were not ſo very conſiderable, if there were a concurrence of no worſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: but that which moſtly is an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay and damp to temporal pleaſures, is the conſequence, a painful and laſting eternity of the ſevereſt puniſhments. 'Tis this life that puts a period and concluſion to the joys of wicked men; whileas the pious have Rivers of pleaſures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more to delight and raviſh them: 'tis at Death that they <hi>enter into the joy of their Lord.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>This</hi> is a ſubject ſo raviſhing and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, that I cannot without reluctancy conclude it. O how unſatisfactory are all the delights of Senſe, if compared with thoſe Spiritual Joys the holy Soul partakes of! The delights that the Drunkard hath
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:135604:61"/>in his Cups and Companions, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous in his Riches, the Ambitious in his Preferments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> fall all incomparable ſhort of that joy that is the lot of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The</hi> delights that the holy man enjoys do upon a double account far over-poiſe the tranſitory pleaſures of the wicked. <hi>Firſt,</hi> the preſent ſatisfaction that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Soul taſtes of in this valley of tears, is incomparably greater than the delights that ariſe from ſenſe. The ſoul that hath once taſted of the love of God, findes more pleaſure in the very acts of mutual love, than in all the feaſts of delight that ſenſe is capable to enjoy. Food is indeed ſweet to the hungry, and drink to thoſe who are languiſhing with thirſt: the taſte does without doubt finde ſome meats ſweet and reliſhing, even where there is no extremity of hunger, much more where it is: for, <hi>to the hungry every bitter thing is ſweet.</hi> Beauteous Sights raviſh the Eye, melodious Muſick the Ear, and Odoriferous things pleaſe the Smell: But alas! how far beyond theſe is the delight which the devout ſoul receives in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances! the antipaſts of joy which their Heavenly Father beſtows upon them, are more delightful than the concurrence of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:135604:62"/>all ſenſual pleaſures. The ſoul that is in trouble can fetch more conſolation from the promiſes of the Word, than the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal man can from his pleaſures: <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs thy Law had been my delight</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>I had periſhed in my affliction.</hi> Other things could not avail him, they could afford no relief: but to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to God in prayer, and to pour out our complaints to our willing God, this is more raviſhing than I can expreſs. And I am ſure there is no man who hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted theſe joys, who would part with them for ſenſual pleaſures; and no man dare inveigh againſt thoſe ſpiritual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, but <hi>ſtrangers who intermeddle not with this joy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The</hi> very Heathens have taught us, that <hi>Vertue is a reward to it ſelf;</hi> they expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimented more real ſatisfaction in mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and temperance, than in Drinking and Whoring. But Chriſtianity gives us more uncontrolable evidences of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of that joy that good men even in this ſtate of abſence taſte of. Into what a rapture and unexpreſſible extaſie of joy did the abundance of revelation St. <hi>Paul</hi> met with put him! and the Apoſtle St. <hi>Peter</hi> was ſo tranſported with joy when he did ſee Chriſt in his Transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:135604:62"/>that he could not forbear crying, <hi>Maſter, it is good being here.</hi> How full of joy have Martyrs been in the midſt of the flames! what comforts have they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven then expreſſed! And is not all this evidence, that the joy of holy men is more real, more ſweet and raviſhing, than the tranſitory pleaſures of the wicked, which in ſeveral ſeaſons can afford no delight? a little pain or diſeaſe is ſuch an allay and damp to their pleaſures, that it quite extirps them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But</hi> beſides thoſe foretaſtes of joy that the holy Soul experiments here, which, as I have ſhewed, infinitely overwhelms all trouble and pain; that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes moſt to advance the joy of good men, are thoſe felicities above, which are prepared for them; and to theſe wicked men can lay no claim, their fartheſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect being confined to temporal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>What</hi> abundance of delights and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible pleaſures are laid up for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Soul above! How delectable will it be, to be conſtant reſidents in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whoſe Streets are pure Gold, and whoſe Gates are Pearl! how raviſhing will it be, to be always in his preſence, where there are Streams and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:135604:63"/>Rivers of perpetual pleaſures? How ſweet will it be, to be a member of that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Society of the firſt-born in Heaven, where there is a perfect concord and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? But I confeſs, I am not able to expreſs half the joy of this future felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath it entred into the hearts of men to conceive,</hi> what a ſtore of happineſs God hath laid up in Heaven for thoſe who are <hi>holy in all manner of converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:135604:65"/>it hath put men to chuſe ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and death rather than life: all which is fully verified by the Word of truth: <hi>The ſpirit of a man can ſuſtain his infirmity; but a wounded ſpirit who can bear?</hi>

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:135604:66"/>It is that vertue which in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner raiſeth the Humane nature above that of Bruits, who act without conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and counſel.

But 'tis no wonder, ſince ſin is that which overclouds and ſtupifies the judgment, and deprives them of thoſe intellectual abilities where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men acquire a right judgement of things. Alas! why ſhould ſuch be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted wiſe, who caſt themſelves in the dirt and puddle, who contaminate and pollute their Souls, who prefer a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to an eternal felicity, who blindly and inconſiderately expoſe themſelves to the wrath of a God-revenging ſin?

And indeed, whatever may be the preſent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prenhenſions and thoughts of men, yet they ſhall ere long paſs this verdict of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect walkers, That they were the onely wiſe men: and the God of wiſdom, who can give the beſt judgement in the caſe, does account the Saints to be wiſe

And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever wicked men may be very daring, yet they cannot be ſaid to be truely valiant; for this is always rational and deliberate: but if wicked men ſhould ſoberly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the unſpeakable hazard they run up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they durſt not be ſo daring; for what conſidering man would thus expoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to danger to be eſteemed gallant, who knows if he miſcarry he is everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingly miſerable? If this merits the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comium of courage, why may not thoſe mad-men who inconſiderately expoſe themſelves to danger, be alſo accounted valiant? Nay, the Horſe that undaunted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but inconſiderately, runs ſo many dangers, encounters ſo many perils in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, may be as truly ſaid to be valiant, as thoſe men: But this is to miſtake quite the true notion of courage.</p>

The moſt adverſe chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that befal ſuch a Soul, cannot denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate it poor; there is a Crown and Princely Inheritance which belongs to it. Nay, beſides that glorious reverſion, we have expreſs promiſes that ſuch Souls ſhall not be altogether deſtitute of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries to ſuſtain and ſupport them in this their pilgrimage.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I have</hi> already ſhewed, that Honour and Pleaſures are the attendants of Holineſs: What in the world is more glorious, than for a man to conquer thoſe luſts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate appetites that ſeek the maſtery over him? what pleaſure is able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:135604:72"/>with thoſe raviſhing joys which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult from a holy converſation? There is nothing imaginable that ſo exhilarates and revives men, as a calm and quiet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. But I paſs this.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>In</hi> the next place I come to ſhew, that the enjoyment of all other bleſſings can never profit that man that wants Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This is plainly atteſted by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, ſaying, <hi>What hath a man profited if he ſhould gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul?</hi> To have an affluence of temporal mercies, cannot ſo much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to a preſent felicity, where the forementioned qualification is lacking. Outward favours, not attended and chai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with real Holineſs, contribute onely to enhance the miſery of their poſſeſſor; they being proper fewel to increaſe the flame of inquietude and reſtleſneſs, but unfit to allay it. The greateſt plenty of riches cannot ſatisfie the covetous minde, which like the Grave cries <hi>Give, give.</hi> The whole world could not ſatisfie <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander</hi>'s inſatiable ambition; but, as the Poet ſpeaks,
<q>
                              <hi>Aeſtuat infoelix anguſto limite mundi.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>'Tis</hi> indeed impoſſible for a man to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:135604:72"/>that earthly felicity he deſigns, if he want Holineſs: For, ſuppoſe he be poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of it, yet the ſecret acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a ſuperiour power, impairs the delights that do ariſe from ſuch a ſtate, and makes him in the height of his fanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed felicity ſtartle and quake. Conſcience, upon the apprehenſion of guilt, and the vengeance due to it, recoils upon the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and diſturbs his quiet enjoyment of the pleaſures he might otherwiſe freely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough delight in. O how does it moleſt and torment him
<q>
                              <hi>Nocte diéque ſuum geſtare in pectore teſtem,</hi>
                           </q> to have an inward principle of Fear haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſinner in his moſt retired enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of pleaſures, which cannot be ſilenced by his utmoſt endeavours! This, this is it that torments him with anguiſh and confuſion, that allays the imaginary pleaſure of the moſt charming Luſt, and <hi>in the midſt of laughter makes his heart heavy:</hi> which fully verifies the truth of what I ſaid, that the enjoyment of all other bleſſings can never free a man from torment, nor a whit profit him that is deſtitute of Holineſs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Holineſs is the moſt incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:135604:73"/>bleſſing, and frees the Soul from the worſt of evils. What <hi>David</hi> ſaid of <hi>Goliahs</hi> Sword, I may more ſafely ſay of Holineſs, <hi>There is none like it;</hi> nothing in the world ſo apt to remove thoſe diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and turmoiling fears that inwardly work upon and damp the minds of men with ſevere checks and laſhes, as Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which being diametrically oppoſite to ſin, which is the worſt of evils, muſt therefore by a neceſſary conſequence be the beſt of bleſſings.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Now</hi> ſeeing contraries placed near to other are the more diſcernable, I ſhall therefore take a ſhort view of the evil and malignity of ſin, that hereby the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and excellency of Holineſs may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the brighter, and have the greater force to conquer our affections.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>To</hi> expreſs the evil and malignity of ſin, Scripture repreſents it by the moſt ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and abominable things, by the moſt dangerous and terrible Diſeaſes: Nay, the great Apoſtle ſeems to want language and compariſons too, to expreſs the evil of it, when he calls it <hi>exceedingly evil,</hi> as if he had ſaid, it infinitely tranſcends all other evils; the malignity of which, no Pen can fully delineate and deſcribe, either in its nature or conſequences.</p>
                        <pb n="135" facs="tcp:135604:73"/>
                        <p>
                           <hi>In</hi> its <hi>Nature;</hi> the Scripture-character of it is, it is <hi>an enmity againſt God;</hi> a <hi>tranſgreſſion</hi> and voluntary violation of his moſt holy and righteous Law; a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience of his Authority, and a wicked contempt of all the divine Attributes: 'tis the woful ſtain and blemiſh of our Natures, the diſeaſe of our Souls, and the reproach of our Reaſon.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The</hi> conſequences of ſin are fearful and fatal. So bad a cauſe can never fail to produce the worſt effects; for beſides all the temporal calamities and miſchiefs that befal Mankinde, thoſe unſpeakable miſeries and extream torments that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company men to the other world, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the dreadful and ſad effects of ſin. I have already ſhewed, that every vice is naturally attended with ſome particular puniſhment: but that indeed which is moſt terrible, which ſhould mightily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze and ſtartle the ſinner, are the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful miſeries of another world: Alas! how diſmal is the condition of thoſe men who have loſt the divine Image, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently his love and favour, and are lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his fury and wrath? who are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd with a <hi>legion</hi> of impure luſts, which lead them captive, and hurry them headlong to perdition, where they muſt
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:135604:74"/>have their everlaſting abode with impure ſpirits and devouring flames.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>How</hi> impoſſible is it to give a juſt Liſt and Catalogue of the ſad and dreadful conſequences of ſin, or fully deſcribe the evil and malignity of it! But yet this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect glance may in part ſatisfie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, that a holy and vertuous life, which excludes all thoſe miſchiefs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies which both in this and the next life attend ſin, is the beſt of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and frees us from the worſt of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Holineſs is the beſt evidence of our being in <hi>favour</hi> with God, and of our <hi>adoption</hi> to Gods Family. How ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous and inquiſitive are many good Chriſtians to underſtand their ſpiritual ſtate and condition, that they may know into which of the two regions of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world they ſhall be ſtated after death? This is certainly a matter of the greateſt conſequence, and deſerves every mans moſt ſerious conſideration; a miſtake here being ſo exceedingly dangerous, like a wound in the vital parts, it proves mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and incurable if continued in. Now the moſt infallible mark and character of our being in favour with God, and that which comprehends all others, is that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:135604:74"/>which the beloved Apoſtle ſets down, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doth righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is righteous.</hi> (<hi>And every one that doth righteouſneſs is born of God,</hi> Chap. 2.29.) <hi>He that committeth ſin is of the Devil— Whoſoever is born of God doth not commit ſin—In this the children of God are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, and the children of the Devil: Whoſoever doth not righteouſneſs, is not of God.</hi> Let men pretend what they will, if they be deſtitute of righteouſneſs, they are of their Father the Devil, and can claim no intereſt in God as their Father; ſeeing it is purity of Spirit that gives us a title to be the Children of the moſt high; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17, 18. <hi>Be ye ſeparate, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye ſhall be my ſons and daughters, ſaith the Lord Almighty.</hi> The whole tenour of the Scripture abounds with ſo many ſuch inſtances, that I ſhall ſuperſede a tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous citation of texts.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>This</hi> then being ſo infallible and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a character, methinks every rational man may quickly come to the knowledge of his ſpiritual eſtate. A bad man may certainly enough know whether he breaks the divine Laws, and goes in a continued
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:135604:75"/>courſe of ſin; and a good man may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently know whether he obeys the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Laws, and is ſincere in his actions. Theſe are things ſo plain and undeniable, that all doubts of this kinde are ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. Now 'tis no difficulty to draw theſe plain inferences: <hi>I break the divine Laws,</hi> therefore <hi>I am not of God:</hi> or, <hi>I obey them,</hi> therefore <hi>I am a Child of God.</hi> And thus every conſidering man, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially conſiders, and exactly examines his life and actions, may be fully enough aſcertained whether he be a Childe of God or not. Alas! how uſeleſs and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous is it to aſcend unto Heaven to ſearch the ſecret and eternal Decrees of God, which belong not to us to pry into, that we may know whether our Names be written in the Book of Life or not? He that doth righteouſneſs needs not fear any latent Decree concerning his reprobation; and it is the vaineſt thing imaginable, for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent and obſtinate ſinners to dream that God hath from eternity elected them to life. The pure nature of God is ſo perfectly oppoſite to ſin, that it is quite impoſſible there can be any agreement betwixt him and ſinners, no more than there can be betwixt light and darkneſs. The Pſalmiſt acquaints us, <hi>That he is not
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:135604:75"/>a God that hath pleaſure in wickedneſs.</hi> And the Apoſtle hath told us, <hi>That the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men.</hi> But yet <hi>the righteous Lord loveth the righteous:</hi> Theſe are the men whom he eſteems his Children, to whom the promiſes of eternal life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>In</hi> the laſt pace, there is nothing in the world that will prove ſo effectual to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort men at the hour of death, as the ſweet thoughts of their being ſeparated from the pollutions of the world. How unſpeakably comfortable is it for men, when they are juſt ſtepping into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, to reflect upon the good life they have led, and that they carry in their boſoms Conſciences void of offence both towards God and towards man? This is indeed that noble and Sovereign Cordial that revives the ſpirits of good men, <hi>in their paſſage through the valley and ſhadow of death,</hi> and makes their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts abound and overflow.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Death</hi> is not ſo ſmall a matter as ſome men think; in Scripture it is not unfitly called <hi>the King of terrours:</hi> Now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can free men from the terrour of it, but a good Conſcience; and this cannot
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:135604:76"/>be had without Holineſs, which makes all calm and ſerene within. It will afford men little pleaſure when they come to die, to reflect upon the earthly pleaſures they have enjoyed: theſe things profit not <hi>in the day of wrath;</hi> but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of well doing makes men ſalute death without dread and aſtoniſhment, and lift up their heads with joy, becauſe <hi>the day of their redemption approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But</hi> with the ungodly and wicked it is not ſo; then their ſins ſtare them in their face, and ſo terrifie and affright them, that no wonder though in the extremity of their agony they prefer ſtrangling and death to life. If holy <hi>Job</hi> doth ſo heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complain of the terrours of God, how much more terrifying ſhall the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of a ſevere and terrible judgement be to the unſanctified and polluted? To think how ſhortly he muſt be everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeparate from the good things he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed here, and be caſt into utter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to have his portion with the damned in devouring Flames, to be an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting reſident in the Lake of fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, where he ſhall be continually tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with that gnawing worm that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dies: Theſe are the amazing thoughts
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:135604:76"/>that will ſeize upon the ſinner: his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience then will not ſleep; nothing will be able to allay thoſe Storms and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts that are raiſed by the fearful expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of the reward due to ſin. At death, men are generally wiſer than at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times; then they begin to conſider what they have been doing, and call themſelves fool a thouſand times for their diſobedience and wickedneſs. The ſmoak of worldly cares that formerly blinded their eyes, are now diſpelled; they ſee their folly, when it is too late to mend it; and if they do no more, yet <hi>Balaam</hi>-like, they will cry, <hi>O that I might die the death of the righteous!</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>THe</hi> former Chapters having diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the <hi>Beauty of Holineſs,</hi> and the mighty power and force of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that excite to the practice of it; one who weighs all this by the meaſures of equity, cannot (as any man would think) but look upon it as the ſtrangeſt prodigie, that ſo juſt a Cauſe ſhould miſs of its effect, and finde the ſons of men, who pretend to be ſuch Maſters of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſo monſtrouſly fooliſh in rejecting it upon the account of ſome frivolous and very fallacious cavils: But the truth is, reſolute Impiety is ſet upon the Bench and made Judge; and no wonder though it paſs an unjuſt ſentence, and condemn Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs becauſe of its oppoſition to Vice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The</hi> common imputations and prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which wicked men load Holineſs with, I ſhall reduce to the four following Heads, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Holineſs lays upon men heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and grievous to be born: which makes humane life joyleſs and uneaſie, they being ſo inconſiſtent, firſt, with
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:135604:77"/>Peace; and ſecondly, with Pleaſure and Satisfaction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Experience informs us, that wicked men enjoy pleaſure and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in their ways, there being no men ſo jovial and merry as they; and that men who pretend to Holineſs are ſullen and melancholy, and are expoſed to heavy ſufferings and trials.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> 'Tis ſingularity and ambition that prevail more with men than any other motive to be holy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> 'Tis the greateſt piece of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ignorance, and impudence, for men to quit with preſent pleaſures for mere un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The</hi> firſt being the moſt material Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, I ſhall therefore more largely and diſtinctly examine it; and in doing of this, I ſhall deſire theſe four things may be conſidered. <hi>Firſt,</hi> that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Laws are not grievous and uneaſie. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that Vice is much more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom and difficult than Vertue. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that Holineſs conduceth both to the Peace and Happineſs of humane Societies, and to the temporal Advantage of private perſons. And <hi>Fourthly,</hi> that there is a great deal of more pleaſure in the ways of Holineſs, than in the commiſſion of ſin.</p>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:135604:78"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That</hi> the divine Laws are not grievous and uneaſie, but extreamly reaſonable and wiſe, is a truth I have already made plain, when I diſcourſed of <hi>the rule of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</hi> The whole tenour of the Laws of Chriſtianity being ſo exceedingly ſuitable to the very nature of men, it cannot be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally ſuppoſed that they can be grievous to them. St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> gives us a brief and compendious, but very full and comprehenſive, account of what things the Laws of our Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty enjoyn, <hi>viz. Whatſoever things are true, whatſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are juſt, whatſoever things are pure, whatſoever things are lovely, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever things are of good report:</hi> all which are ſo agreeable to Reaſon, that even the light of Nature prompts men to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, and fully diſcovers it ſelf to be an irreconcilable Enemy to all kinde of vices.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>'Tis</hi> not then Reaſon, but the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Luſts of men, that determines a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Law to be grievous and uneaſie: and indeed, no wonder though this unjuſt Judge make Holineſs appear formidable, and repreſent it as grievous to Mankinde; it being ſo much the intereſt of this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Judge to condem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> it as criminal,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:135604:78"/>and to decrie it as a yoak intolerable and grievous to be born. 'Tis not probable that the moſt innocent ſhall paſs unconde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mned, when an Enemy is ſet up in the Judgement ſeat to paſs Sentence: our bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> muſt be pronounced guilty by <hi>Pilat,</hi> although even this uniuſt Judge openly profeſt, <hi>he found no fault in him.</hi> And ſeeing our great Law-giver met with ſo ſevere a ſentence, who can expect any more upright verdicts ſhould paſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Laws?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But</hi> that the divine Laws are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed grievous to be born, may eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from plain Texts of Scripture (which is the onely infallible rule.) Our great Lord hath himſelf taught his Diſciples, <hi>That his yoak is eaſie, and his burden light.</hi> And one of his inſpired Diſciples has aſſured us, <hi>that his commands are not grievous:</hi> two Texts ſufficient methinks to remove all thoſe prejudices that are caſt upon a holy life, as if it were full of fatigue and trouble.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But</hi> beſides Scripture, Reaſon and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience too, come in to witneſs this truth. <hi>Firſt, Reaſon</hi> bears witneſs that the divine Commands are extreamly reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and natural; and is it not againſt the common vote of Mankinde, to ſay, What
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:135604:79"/>is natural, is uneaſie and difficult? Men who impoſe hard and grievous taſks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others, are by all men condemned as unreaſonable; which certainly implies, that whatever is reaſonable, is not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and difficult. 'Tis true, ſinners, who by their many-repeated acts of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience have contracted a habit of ſin, do indeed commit it with leſs trouble than thoſe who firſt engage to this Tyranny; as Slaves, who by cuſtom look upon that as eaſie, which at their firſt entrance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch a ſlavery was very difficult and grievous: And yet whatever eaſe the moſt daring ſinner may pretend is to be found in the acts of ſin, I durſt appeal to his own breaſt, whether he might not with a great deal of more eaſe, and leſs fatigue, have kept the divine Laws, than he met with in breaking of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I confeſs,</hi> the Laws of Chriſtianity are not natural in a ſtrict and confined ſence; but onely in ſo far as they correſpond with, and are ſuitable to, the nature of Mankinde: hence ſome ſins are ſaid to be <hi>unnatural;</hi> not becauſe all ſins may not adopt to themſelves that title, but becauſe upon a more peculiar and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial account, all men are ſenſible that they are bruitiſh, and unbecoming any who
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:135604:79"/>carry in their boſom a rational Soul. There is not any vice, but it infeſts and prejudges Nature. <hi>Anger</hi> is a degree of Madneſs, that violently tranſports men, and quite mars their inward eaſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. <hi>Revenge,</hi> a more laſting and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate fury, preys upon the Soul where it reſides, and ſo diſtracts and hurries it with inquietude and reſtleſneſs, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing imaginable can be ſuppoſed a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Enemy to Nature, how ſweet ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and luſcious it may ſeem to depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved nature. <hi>Intemperance,</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> are ſins which debaſe Humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture below that of beaſts, and are the cauſe of many intolerable pains and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, which make Humane life but an uneaſie burden. But beſides all theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, we may adde that horrour of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that haunts the ſinner with fear and aſtoniſhment. All which contribute to clear the truth of what I aſſert.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Again,</hi> Reaſon tells a man, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be grievous to him to perform that which is ſo much his intereſt and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Men in their ſecular concerns finde no difficulties in any undertaking wherein their intereſt is concerned; and ſure it is mans greateſt intereſt to keep the divine Precepts, as I have already at
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:135604:80"/>ſome length diſcovered. 'Tis an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſaying, of as excellent an Author: <hi>Reaſon</hi> (ſays he) <hi>must first ceaſe to be Reaſon, and commence</hi> Phrenzie, <hi>before 'tis poſſible it can ſet it ſelf in defiance of thoſe Laws of Christ, which are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to its greatest interest.</hi> Cauſes of the decay of Chriſtian Piety, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But</hi> beſides Reaſon, Experience bears alſo witneſs to this truth, that the divine Laws are not grievous. But before I proceed to prove this, I ſhall premiſe two Cautions: <hi>First,</hi> when I ſay that Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience makes it plain, that the Laws of Chriſtianity are not grievous; I do not mean that a ſinner when he firſt forſaketh his ſins, and betakes himſelf to a holy and vertuous life, ſhall encounter with no difficulties; no ſure, this cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be expected: for his former ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit in ſin will at the firſt give him work enough; he has an old cuſtom to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and ſtruggle with, which will coſt him no ſmall pains to overcome. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> far leſs muſt we fondly imagine that the Law of Chriſtianity is ſo eaſie, as ſuperſedes and gives a diſcharge to humane induſtry, vigilancy, and care: they are but ſtrangers to a holy life, and never knew what it is to obey Gods
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:135604:80"/>Commands, who never were at any pains, nay who are not very induſtrious and careful to obſerve them. When our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſays, <hi>his yoak is eaſie,</hi> he does not hereby intend to perſwade men to be like <hi>Solomons</hi> ſluggard; ſure Heaven was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verdeſigned for loiterres in Gods Vineyard: but his intent there, is to remove a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prejudice men were like to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain againſt Chriſtianity, as if it were an intolerable yoak, and inſupportable taſk: now this Chriſt forewarns his Diſciples is not true.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Theſe</hi> two things being premiſed, I now appeal to Experience (which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten corrects errour in ſpeculation) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Laws of Heaven or Hell are moſt grievous. And to condeſcend as far as poſſible, I ſhall not here call in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences of good men, who all unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly aſſent that there is more eaſe and leſs fatigue in obeying, than in breaking the divine Laws; but I ſhall ſubmit to the ſinners own teſtimony, when he is in his moſt ſober ſtate; I mean, when he is under the extremity of ſome pain infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by his ſins, or when he lies upon his death-bed: at other times, when he is in the purſute of ſome Luſt, no wonder though he paſs as unjuſt a ſentence as ſick
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:135604:81"/>men do of taſtes, who having their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates infected with ſome venomous and filthy humor, judge every thing, be it really never ſo pleaſant, to be bitter and harſh.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Go</hi> then to ſinners when they come to themſelves (as it is ſaid of the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, <hi>He came to himſelf,</hi> as if he had been before mad or diſtracted) and aſk them whether they ſinde more trouble in their doing or omitting of ſin? Aſk the Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, who by his intemperance lies ſmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting under the tormenting pains of the Gout, whether he had been wiſer, and ſuffered leſs trouble, if he had been tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and abſtained from exceſs? Nay, beſides the diſeaſes that many, if not moſt of vices bring upon men, there are ſome ſins that make men ſenſibly in the time finde pain and trouble. Go to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcivious and Wanton perſon who is tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the Pox, and aſk whether his ſin be grievous to him or not? There are few ſins which are not attended with grievous concomitants. But I ſhall not inſiſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I confeſs,</hi> no mens Experiences are ſo likely to demonſtrate this truth, nor are more pertinently appealed to, as theirs who have once experimented the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:135604:81"/>and pains of both ſtates: Aſk there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe who were once Drunkards and Adulterers, but are now ſanctified and ſettled in a courſe of Holineſs; and I am ſure they ſhall verily teſtifie, that it is only Satan's Yoak that is uneaſie and burthenſome.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But</hi> granting that there is ſome difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the exact obſervation of the Laws of Chriſtianity, (as ſure any man who conſults the corruption of his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the depraved inclinations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, againſt which they are levelled, will never deny) yet if this ſhall be judged a good Argument to cancel the Laws of Chriſtianity, all Laws whatſoever ſhall be quite daſhed out, and baniſhed the world; for who ſhall be guilty, if he may have the liberty to uſe this for a relevant excuſe?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This</hi> being then ſo unreaſonable to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, (and if it ſhould be admitted, ſhould yet never a whit excuſe the ſinner, who to his experience findes ſin to be ſo uneaſie and troubleſome) yet I ſhall adde two Conſiderations that demonſtrate, the Laws of Chriſtianity are more eaſie than any other Laws that ever were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented; and that they are not (as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal men repreſent them) <hi>hard ſayings
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:135604:82"/>which none can bear.</hi> Firſt, the Author of the Goſpel-precepts hath offered to us an aſſiſtance, able to conquer all the difficulties that can be ſuppoſed to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the keeping of his Mandates. 'Tis true, if Chriſt had enjoyned his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to obey a Law which could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be kept; I confeſs, in that caſe, his Commands had been grievous, and his Yoak inſupportable: Or if he had been ſatisfied with no leſs than perfect inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and unſinning obedience, I don't ſee how this prejudice and cavil could have been removed. But he who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed thoſe Precepts, conſidered the frailties of our nature, and the weakneſs of man in this lapſed eſtate; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he has provided help for us, if we will but be at the pains ſeriouſly to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore it; <hi>For he giveth his Spirit to them that ask it.</hi> And upon this account the beloved Apoſtle encourageth Chriſtians to obey the precepts of the Goſpel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, <hi>Greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The excellency of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that is promiſed to the obedient, is a moſt noble conſideration to make men (as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks) run the way of Gods Commandments. The promiſſory
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:135604:82"/>part of the Goſpel, renders the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptive part eaſie. Methinks the holy Soul ſhould with comfort thus expreſs it ſelf, when the greateſt difficulties offer: Good God! ſhall I be diſcouraged to obey the hardeſt (if any thing proceeding from infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs can be ſaid to be difficult) of thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when ſo glorious a prize is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thereof? If a terrene and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral felicity animates others to encounter the moſt Giant-difficulties, how much more unconcernedly ſhould I ſlight all hazards, and contemn by a fearleſs cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage all dangers, for that <hi>bleſſed hope that is ſet before me?</hi> Can I remember there is a Kingdom promiſed, and yet be terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from it by ſuppoſed difficulties, or complain that the way is inacceſſible? Do I really know that it is indeed a good Land, and am yet diſcouraged to attempt the taking of it, becauſe it will require ſome violence? Shall I, like the <hi>Reube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> and <hi>Gadites,</hi> ſet up my reſt on this ſide of <hi>Jordan,</hi> notwithſtanding this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of <hi>Canaan?</hi> No ſure, eternal Life is too noble a prize to be loſt, for fear of fighting the Good fight. I regard no difficulties while I eye the Crown; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think thoſe Precepts grievous, that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:135604:83"/>are enforced by ſo many excellent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. So great a recompence of reward ſhould, methinks, inſpire the dulleſt Heart, and ſweeten the hardeſt Service; ſhould make any one willing and content to ſacrifice his moſt beloved luſts, to cut off the right Hand, and pluck out the right eye, which ſtand in the way, and hinder him from entring into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Having</hi> thus endeavoured to explain upon what account the Laws of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity are not grievous, I hope I ſhall not need to inſiſt long upon the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particulars. At firſt ſight it ſeems plain, that ſince the caſe is ſo, Vice muſt certainly be more troubleſome than Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and that it is eaſier for men to live holily, than wickedly: and yet, I know not by what ſtrange artifice, Holineſs has had the bad luck to be repreſented as being extreamly difficult. I confeſs, I intend not to inveigh againſt the ſacred Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> who have repreſented Heaven almoſt as unacceſſible, as the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelitiſh <hi>Spies</hi> did the good Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan;</hi> knowing they thereby onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne to raiſe mens endeavours: although I could have wiſhed that they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered better, how readily men of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:135604:83"/>mindes and vitious practices lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide all care of Gods Commandments, upon this ſuggeſtion, that they are grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous; and are deterred from a holy and vertuous life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But</hi> that Vice is more troubleſome and uneaſie than Vertue, will (beſides what I have formerly ſaid) appear to be ſo, from the following Conſiderations. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Sacred Records repreſent ſinners as men who <hi>weary themſelves with ſin;</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> deſcribes their trouble by a very apt ſim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>litude, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.20. <hi>The wicked is like the troubled ſea, when it cannot reſt, whoſe waters caſt up mire and dirt.</hi> The ways of ſin are frequently called <hi>crooked paths,</hi> and wicked men are ſaid <hi>to walk aſtray;</hi> whileas the way of Holineſs and Vertue is ſaid to be a <hi>ſtreight</hi> and <hi>high way:</hi> All which Phraſes plainly enough imply, that the former is full of intricacy and perplexities, and the latter plain and eaſie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Experiences</hi> to prove this, are every day ſo multiplied, that they may abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſerve to ſilence all doubts. The <hi>Drunkard</hi> can experimentally tell the coſtlineſs of his ſin, and the tormenting diſeaſes that are frequently the effect of an overcharged Stomach; the uneaſie
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:135604:84"/>belchings and overturnings within, the grievous pains of Head and Joynts. The <hi>Wanton</hi> and <hi>Laſcivious</hi> can produce his painful boils and ſores, to witneſs the uneaſineſs of Luſt; at beſt, he can onely produce an hectick Body. But beſides thoſe loathſome diſeaſes that are the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Laſciviouſneſs, how reſtleſs and uneaſie is the condition of ſuch perſons? But how impoſſible is it to give a juſt liſt of thoſe miſeries that Wantonneſs and Intemperance hurry men to? To what a multitude of amazing difficulties does <hi>Pride</hi> expoſe men! what miſchiefs, jarrs and conteſts does it raiſe? <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge</hi> torment mens ſpirits, and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet and perturb them, that men may as well take fire into their boſom, and pretend they perceive no torment, as lodge thoſe horrid luſts in their breaſts without the ſenſe of their extream miſery and pain. The <hi>Covetous</hi> minde is never at reſt, but is ever craving and deſirous of more. But to ſhew how troubleſome the practice of every ſin is, requires a larger diſcourſe than I can well allow.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But</hi> how eaſie is Vertue, if compared with Vice? At what trouble and pains are men, to invent a lie? and when they have contrived it, they cannot but be
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:135604:84"/>afraid leſt it be diſcovered. But how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie is it to ſpeak the truth? With how much art and pains do men trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to conceal their vices? The Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer is wearied with watching conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient opportunities, and afraid leſt he be diſcovered; whileas the chaſt perſon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys himſelf quietly, and is troubled with no ſuch attender. The <hi>covetous Miſer</hi> is cruciate and tormented with a deſire of what he cannot expect; is extreamly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by an inceſſant care, leſt he loſe what he hath, and ever toiling to acquire more; whileas the vertuous Soul is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with what he enjoyeth, and grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to beſtow a part of what is his to others.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>There</hi> is no man who is not quite given up to commit all manner of wickedneſs, and whoſe conſcience is not ſeared as with a hot Iron, but can tell by his experience, how perplexing and uneaſie Vice is. And to make this yet more plain, I ſhall adde theſe few following Reaſons. <hi>First,</hi> the nature of Vice is ſo reproachful, that men are even troubled to coyn ſhifts to avoid the owning it; and ſure this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be uneaſie to men. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the moſt viciouſly inclined perſons, who will not practiſe, yet are forced for their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:135604:85"/>to pretend Vertue, and uſually indeed become greater Zealots than thoſe who are really vertuous: But this cannot but be exceedingly troubleſom to them, it being againſt their inclinations, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to the internal ſentiments of their mindes. And beſides, at what pains are they to make other men believe that they are real in what they onely pretend? <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Vice is very perplexing and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, upon the account that it requires hard, if not impoſſible performances: the Covetous minde is prompted to attempt many difficulties to obtain what it craves, and after all is diſappointed. Nay, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Covetouſneſs is a vice ſo uneaſie and troubleſome, that it propoſeth what can never be acquired: for after it hath got what is deſigned, it is reſtleſs, and as ready to ſay <hi>Give, give,</hi> as ever. But <hi>Laſtly,</hi> that which contributes moſt to render Vice uneaſie, are thoſe after-pangs of Conſcience which fill the Soul with horrour and amazement; the conſciouſneſs of guilt ſtings and torments it, and makes the ſinner a terrour to himſelf. 'Tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible either to <hi>gag</hi> or corrupt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that it ſhall never give any check. But now how quieting and ſolacing is Vertue? no man ever yet complained that
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:135604:85"/>terrours haunted him for living holily. O how do the thoughts of a vertuous life refreſh men in the midſt of greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers? Let us go to ſinners on their death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and then we ſhall finde this truth preached to the full; an evidence valid enough to condemn ſin as the uneaſieſt thing imaginable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And</hi> thus we have ſeen how many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties attend ſin, both before, and after it is committed. And now what reaſon can any man alleadge for the pretended eaſineſs of ſin? I confeſs, I know not any thing, except it be <hi>cuſtom,</hi> that can be pertinently adduced; but how weak is this Plea? for although Cuſtom, which is a ſecond nature, may contribute very much to ſtupifie the Judgment, and harden the Conſcience, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently make Vice the more eaſie; yet we can hardly ſuppoſe that ever Humane nature will ſo far aſſimilate the nature of mere Animals, as to be deprived of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Conſcience: And ſure, ſo long as any of theſe remain, Vice muſt needs meet with oppoſition. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> if men will compare the eaſineſs of Vertue and Vice, they muſt put them in equal circumſtances; and then I doubt not but Vice ſhall ſtand condemned, as the great
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:135604:86"/>troubler of peace and quietneſs. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, let us ſuppoſe that a man is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to a holy life, and is habituate to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly; in this caſe, let any man make but the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, and I am ſure he ſhall ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly acknowledge, that a good life af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords more tranquillity and peace, than Vice dares lay claim to.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And</hi> yet, I know not by what bad luck, Holineſs has been repreſented as oppoſite to mens preſent welfare, and hurtful to their peace and tranquillity. How ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs this prejudice is, I have already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſhew. I ſhall therefore now onely in a few words make it plain, that Holineſs is the moſt effectual method that can be taken, to exalt the publick peace and happineſs of a Nation. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> that it infinitely conduceth to the happineſs, peace, and tranquillity of particular perſons; and that nothing is ſo inconſiſtent with, and hurtful to both, as ſin.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>How</hi> much Holineſs tends to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of publick peace in a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Nation, appears very plainly from the Wiſe mans obſervation, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.34. <hi>Righteouſneſs exalteth a nation; but ſin is the reproach of any people.</hi> And
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:135604:86"/>the Apoſtle St. <hi>James</hi> gives us a true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the cauſes of publick jars, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.1. <hi>From whence come wars and ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings amongst you? are they not hence, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from your lusts that war in your mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers?</hi> If minkinde had not corrupted their ways, and degenerated from their priſtine purity, how peaceable and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py had humane ſocieties been? but in this lapſed ſtate, Ambition, Pride, and Injuſtice act their tragical parts, and ſo tend to the deſtruction of humane ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that if there did not remain ſome ſparks and remainders of Religion, 'tis not poſſible that humane ſociety could evite an utter ruine. And he that well ponders the ſettled courſe of divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, ſhall eaſily aſſent, that in all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges Righteouſneſs and Vertue have been rewarded with a temporal tranquillity and happineſs; and that <hi>fruitful lands have been turned into barrenneſs, for the wickedneſs of them that dwell therein.</hi> And indeed 'tis very reaſonable to think that the divine Juſtice will reward a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Nation, and puniſh a rebellious People. 'Tis true, he may defer his Judgements for a while, yet his Juſtice will not always give place to mercy and forbearance; but a Nation that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:135604:87"/>and increaſeth its provocations, muſt expect to be puniſhed in this world, (which is the onely proper place) as a righteous Land may expect a preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That</hi> Holineſs doth alſo conduce to the peace and quietneſs of particular perſons, is nothing leſs evident from Scripture: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.165. <hi>Great peace have they that love thy Law, and nothing ſhall offend them:</hi> but <hi>the wicked is like the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſea when it cannot reſt, whoſe waters cast up mire and dirt,</hi> Iſa. 57.20. I have once and again ſhewed, that there can be no inward tranquillity and peace, where Holineſs is wanting: the very thoughts of God, which above all things are moſt ſweet, are notwithſtanding troubleſome to wicked men. But becauſe Humane nature is in this degenerate ſtate extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſunk down into Senſe, and more apt to be wrought upon by temporal advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, than what onely concern the Soul, and have a proſpect to things that are future; I have alſo in the former part of this Diſcourſe endeavoured to make plain, how advantageous Holineſs is upon the foreſaid account; and <hi>that length of days are in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and honour:</hi> That <hi>her
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:135604:87"/>ways are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths peace:</hi> That <hi>Godlineſs is great gain, having the promiſes of the life that now is, as well as of that which is to come.</hi> And indeed, any man, who conſiders the nature and reaſon of the thing, cannot but be inclined to think it muſt be ſo: For how can that man be expoſed to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and diſquietment, who hath gotten the maſtery over his Paſſions? And I dare appeal to the ſinners own experience, whether vices have not been prejudicial to his health, macerated his Body, and filled him with tortures and pains? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome ſins have not brought him to poverty and diſgrace, ruined both his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and fame? Can any man produce any good effect that ever ſin cauſed? ſure, if men would ſpeak impartially, they ſhould acknowledge all this to be true.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That</hi> there is a great deal of more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the ways of Holineſs than in the commiſſion of ſin, (which is the fourth thing propoſed to be conſidered) needs not puzzle any man to prove it. How de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful are all acts of Piety and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue? how unexpreſſible is that comfort that the devout Soul findes in converſing with God? Well might the Pſalmiſt ſay, <hi>Light is ſown for the righteous, and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:135604:88"/>for the upright in heart,</hi> Pſal. 97.11. he often experienced that ſweetneſs and ſatisfaction that is the reſult of obedience; whileas <hi>Solomon,</hi> who could paſs the beſt verdict of ſenſual pleaſures, yet concludes them to be but <hi>vanity and vexation of ſpirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>There</hi> be two things that allay the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſin: <hi>Firſt,</hi> the unrulineſs of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate paſſions, which fret and vex the mindes of men, and hinder the ſinner from taſting its pleaſure. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the fear of an inviſible being, armed to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them for their miſdemeanors: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, upon the apprehenſion of guilt, recoils upon the ſinner, and mars all the pleaſure he promiſed himſelf to enjoy: This made <hi>Belſhazzer,</hi> a King, and envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned with his Nobles, tremble and quake in the midſt of his cups. But ſuppoſing vices did bring as much pleaſure along with them as they pretend, yet upon two accounts they are not half ſo delicious as the pleaſures that ſpring from a good life. <hi>Firſt,</hi> the pleaſures of ſin are ſo interrupted, of a ſhort duration, or, as the Apoſtle expreſſeth them, they are but <hi>for a ſeaſon:</hi> how quickly will a period be put to all theſe pleaſures, which now make ſo much noiſe? They are very fitly
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:135604:88"/>compared by <hi>Solomon,</hi> to <hi>the crackling of thorns under a pot,</hi> which are ſcarce ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in a blaze, than they vaniſh; but the joys that ſpring from a good converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are at their loweſt ebb here: they do indeed continue, <hi>for no man taketh away this joy;</hi> but Heaven is the deſigned place for the good Soul to feed upon thoſe <hi>Rivers of pleaſures that are at God's right hand for evermore. Secondly,</hi> ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual pleaſures do ſoon cloy mens appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites: we cannot enjoy long any ſenſual delight, but we are quickly weary of it: but it is not ſo with ſpiritual delights; 'tis onely the abſence of them, when ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended for our ſins, that troubles and moleſts us. 'Tis impoſſible that ſenſual pleaſures can ſatisfie the ſoul of man, which was never framed for a Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Paradiſe; nor can it be rationally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that he who is conſcious to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of guilt, ſhould be free from fear; which being ſo tormenting, can never permit men to enjoy pleaſure freely.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But</hi> let us deſcend to ſenſual pleaſures, and we ſhall finde, that he who is tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and moderate, is more likely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the pleaſantneſs of Meat, Drink, and Paſtime, than the intemperate and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate. He who relieves the Poor, and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:135604:89"/>refreſheth the Needy, cannot but finde more real ſweetneſs and ſatisfaction in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, than he who drinks away his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. He who ſpeaks the truth, findes not thoſe tormenting checks of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which are the juſt reward of lying. But all this will more plainly appear, by the Solution of the next Objection.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The</hi> ſecond Imputation is brought from Experience; namely, that wicked men are for ordinary very jovial and cheerful, and enjoy a great deal of ſatisfacton in their ways; whereas men who pretend to Piety and Holineſs, are very ſad and diſconſolate.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To</hi> this I anſwer; That the Queſtion is not, whether wicked men have ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in their ſins, or not? but, whether that pleaſure that ariſeth from a good life, be not infinitely preferable to theſe? Alas! the moſt promiſing ſenſual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure (ſuppoſing it to be lawful) is much inferiour to the ſatisfaction and comfort that ſprings from a good Conſcience. How much more inconſiderable muſt ſinful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures be, which are attended with ſo black and diſmal conſequences? <hi>Indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh upon every ſoul of man that doth evil.</hi> Sinful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are at the beſt but ſhort; and ſure
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:135604:89"/>this, conſideration contributes very much to leſſen their value; But that which makes them ſo mean, and not worth the enjoying, is the painful Eternity that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>However</hi> then the wicked may appear jovial and merry, yet their inward thoughts (if we could diſcover them) cannot be at quiet and eaſe: Whatever pleaſure they may reap in the preſent act, yet they cannot afterwards look unto themſelves without horrour and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The after-ſtings of ſin are ſo pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that he buys thoſe preſent pleaſures at a rate no reaſonable man would pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But</hi> that wicked men cannot really en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy that pleaſure and contentment they pretend to, ſeems very plain from Reaſon. For <hi>first,</hi> How can any man be ſatisfied with thoſe actions which are ſo croſs to his very nature, and oppoſite to Reaſon, as every ſin is? Can a man finde plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in doing that which he knows he ought not to do? ſure the reboundings of Conſcience, upon the apprehenſion of doing amiſs, will ſoon raſe out any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that ſin affords; and a ſick man may more rationally expect reſt, than thoſe men pleaſure and contentment. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
                        <pb n="168" facs="tcp:135604:90"/>it can afford little pleaſure to men, to act quite contrary to their own intereſts; it is rather like the laughter of fools and mad men, than a real pleaſure, that ſuch men can pretend to. Now every ſinner quite ruines his intereſt and happineſs, while he runneth headlong to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and for a preſent pleaſure, which is onely grateful to the ſenſual appetite, loſeth thoſe laſting Rivers of pleaſure, which, though future, are yet certain, and which are calculated for the Soul. <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> What pleaſure can any man enjoy, who is ſure to be eternally tormented? As <hi>there is no peace,</hi> ſo no pleaſure <hi>to the wicked,</hi> who are at oddes with God, <hi>whoſe favour is better than life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But</hi> what reaſon have good men to be ſad and diſconſolate, ſince all the cauſes of grief are removed from them? <hi>Light is ſown for the righteous, and gladneſs for the upright in heart;</hi> ſo that the Apoſtle had good reaſon to double that Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord, again I ſay re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.</hi> O how ſatisfying and pleaſant is it for men to act reaſonably, and to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that they have done their duty, and have acted for their own intereſt! <hi>Our rejoycing is this,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>the teſtimony of our conſciences, that in all
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:135604:90"/>ſimplicity and godly ſincerity we have had our converſation in the world.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sure</hi> there was never any man who was troubled for living holily, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no reaſon why any ſhould: 'Tis true, good men may be of a melancholy diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and naturally inclined to ſadneſs; but this can be no reflection on Holineſs, as if it were the cauſe of that melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly temper: nay, the beſt of men have their own failings, and no wonder though theſe breed ſome trouble and diſquiet: But this is not to be diſconſolate for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, but for doing evil. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I may adde, that the great abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and profanity, the contempt of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and diſhonour that is done to God that abounds, may very rationally make good men with the Pſalmiſt ſay, <hi>Rivers of tears run down my eyes, becauſe men obſerve not thy Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And</hi> thus this imputation caſt upon Holineſs, is eaſily wip'd off. Grief and ſadneſs are not the effect of a good life; but of an imperfect obedience: And while our ſins call for mourning and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, it were a piece of madneſs for men to be jovial and merry, and entertain themſelves with thoſe deceitful melodies, which will end <hi>in weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:135604:91"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And</hi> yet the ſorrow of truely good men is not ſo obvious to the eye of men, as it is to him who is <hi>the ſearcher of the heart;</hi> it is rather the artifice of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Penitent, and hypocritical Profeſſor, than the character of the Righteous, to <hi>disfigure their faces,</hi> and appear ſad and demure. A good man chuſeth rather, with <hi>David,</hi> to mourn in ſecret, and when he appears in publick to waſh his face, than with thoſe Hypocrites of whom <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks, who <hi>bow down their head like a bull-ruſh,</hi> who have <hi>choſen affliction rather than innocence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The</hi> next imputation caſt upon Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is, that it is but a piece of <hi>ſingulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and a vain ambition to walk alone. <hi>Anſ.</hi> I am heartily ſorry that the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal deluge of Impiety ſhould make good men ſay as once <hi>Elijah</hi> did in another caſe, <hi>I am onely left:</hi> the few number of good men, compared with the vaſt mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and Armies of tranſgreſſors, makes them to be eſteemed ſingular and preciſe; and brings upon them the wrath and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ungodly ſinners, becauſe <hi>they will not run with them to the ſame exceſs of riot,</hi> and wallow in the mire as they do. But truely this charge is not more ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, than if a company of mad men ſhould
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:135604:91"/>call one a ſingular fool, becauſe he does not comply with them in all their extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant actings, which do really rather require pity and compaſſion than imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I doubt</hi> not but Singularity in ſome caſes is a very intolerable temper, and unbecoming any man who pretends wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: but yet, if it be univerſally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and in no caſe admitted as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, I don't ſee but the charge will rebound upon the ſinner, who in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate age thinks the worſe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, if he exceed not others in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But</hi> ſince Holineſs is ſo conformable to Humane reaſon, ſo advantageous and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to every man; what madneſs is it to condemn it as ſingular? Sure, he who intends to walk as a man who is <hi>of a good understanding,</hi> (as good men are ſaid to be) who intends to minde his intereſt and happineſs, will never be frighted from Holineſs, becauſe may be it is not in vogue, nor become the mode of the Kingdome. If a whole Kingdom (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting a few) ſhould rebel againſt their Prince, would it be any blot upon theſe ſew Loyal Subjects, that they affected Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity?</p>
                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:135604:92"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But</hi> this cavil is ſo inſignificant and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that I need not enlarge. Sure, ſince Holineſs is the peculiar excellency and noble embelliſhment of Humane nature; ſince it is ſo venerable and lovely, and of all perfections the moſt excellent; he muſt be degenerate to the brutal nature, who condemns Singularity in Holineſs; for this is in truth a condemning a man becauſe he is <hi>more excellent than his neighbour,</hi> as the righteous is ſaid to be in Scripture.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The</hi> laſt heavy Charge is, that it is folly and madneſs for men to quit with their preſent pleaſures, and expoſe themſelves to grievous troubles, for a future reward which is uncertain, and which no body e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw. To this I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Firſt, it is a great miſtake to think that Holineſs expoſeth men to relinquiſh temporal and ſenſual pleaſures; there being no men in the world ſo qualified to experiment the ſweetneſs of theſe, none who live in ſo happy and flouriſhing condition, who are more healthful, and enjoy a greater meaſure of peace and quietneſs, than good men. The onely inconveniency they are expoſed to, is affliction upon the account of Religion; which when Chriſtianity did commence, was no rare thing, but now is not ſo ordinary. But ſuppoſing
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:135604:92"/>good men were expoſed to greater affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions than other men, yet there is a great deal of ſatisfaction in ſubmitting to them, ſince they are but <hi>light afflictions,</hi> and <hi>momentary</hi> too, <hi>which work for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> Theſe ſmall evils are rather to be endured, than laſting pains and torments. Sure, Of two evils, the leaſt is to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Although the reward of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs be future, yet 'tis not uncertain. We have as great aſſurance that there will be a reward for the Righteous in another world, as the nature of the thing is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of: and ſure he is an unwiſe man that aſks any other demonſtration or proof. Now that there is a reward laid up for good men, which though unſeen, is yet as certain as if it were obvious to ſenſe, we have the greateſt rational evidence, and the beſt moral arguments to confirm it. For <hi>first,</hi> if there be a God; <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> if the Scriptures be the Word of God, then there is not any thing more certain, than that there is a ſtate of rewards and puniſhments after this life. <hi>Firſt,</hi> if there be a God, then we can have no reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſcruple about the future reward: for ſince God is <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>juſt</hi> (perfections eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:135604:93"/>to a Deity) then certainly he will, as the great Governor of the World, reward Vertue, and puniſh Vice. But this doth not always fall out ſo here; therefore it is reaſonable to conclude, that he hath reſerved the wicked till that great day of wrath, and prepared a reward for the righteous. <hi>Secondly,</hi> if the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture be the Word of God, then he who runs may read this truth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>We</hi> have then the greateſt moral aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance poſſible, that there is a future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; which may ſufficiently encourage men to hazard all they enjoy here, for the expectation of it. But I ſhall onely ſuppoſe that the future reward is poſſible; (which I think few will deny, or can prove it to be impoſſible) yet even up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſuppoſition, good men who part with the tranſitory things of this life, prove a great deal wiſer than thoſe who condemn them: For if there be no life after this, all the loſs a good man ſuffers, is that of temporal conveniency; he hath denied himſelf the enjoyment of ſenſual pleaſures, ſo far as he judgeth them ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; he is not ſo intemperate as other men, and perhaps is expoſed to ſome ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards for his Religion; at the moſt, <hi>all</hi> that he is to hazard is but very ſmall.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:135604:93"/>But if there be a future reward, in what a diſmal ſtate are the wicked, who ſhall everlaſtingly be deprived of it, and be irrecoverably plunged into a ſtate of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and ſevere torments?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But</hi> ſince we are aſſured of a future reward, and know certainly, that <hi>the righteous ſhall ſhine forth as the ſun in the Kingdom of their Father,</hi> and that the wicked <hi>ſhall be cast into utter darkneſs;</hi> What folly and madneſs is it to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the Body, and careleſs what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of the Soul; to provide for Time, and neglect Eternity? Sure 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der though the Wiſe man does ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently characterize the ſinner a <hi>fool,</hi> and repreſents him as one that <hi>lacketh under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing:</hi> And indeed, we may rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, <hi>This their way is their folly;</hi> their fooliſh choice proclaims, <hi>that thoſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of iniquity have no knowledge.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <head>The Concluſion.</head>
                     <p>WE have now ſeen the Excellency and Beauty of Holineſs, have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the abſolute Perfection of its Nature, and the Compleatneſs of its Rule; have taken a view of its Allurements and powerful Motives, and have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the weakneſs of thoſe Cavils that are urged againſt it: and what remains, but that we ſet about this work with the greateſt ſeriouſneſs imaginable; that <hi>we give no ſleep to our eyes, nor ſlumber to our eye-lids,</hi> till we forſake our ſins, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon a courſe of Holineſs?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If</hi> God had impoſed upon us a heavy and intolerable yoak; if he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to perform ſome grievous and uneaſie ſervice, had we not been obliged to have obeyed? But ſince he onely commands us <hi>to waſh and be clean,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires onely our conſent to what is ſo much our own intereſt, onely exacts that we ſeparate our ſelves from thoſe luſts that pollute and defile us, that vex and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:135604:94"/>torments our mindes, and which (if continued in) will certainly ruine and undo us; what fools and mad-men are we if we refuſe to hear his voice?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Almighty</hi> God has been drawing us with the Cords of Love; has preſented to us the moſt charming motives to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite our love and eſteem; has carried us (as it were) to the <hi>Pinacle</hi> of the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and diſcovered to us <hi>all the glory and beauty of this world;</hi> has taken us to <hi>Piſgah,</hi> and given us a view of the good Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> of <hi>the City of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, of which glorious things are ſpoken;</hi> and promiſed, that <hi>all theſe things ſhall be ours,</hi> if we will but <hi>be holy in all manner of converſation:</hi> And to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite our fear, he has opened to our view, <hi>the powers of the world to come;</hi> has plainly told us of the pains and torments that the damned ſuffer day and night, and that <hi>indignation and wrath, tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and anguiſh,</hi> remains as the due por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe that do evil. And now may he not take up that ſame proteſtation that he uſed to his ancient People the Jews; <hi>What more can I do for you?</hi> But alas! we have in the moſt inſolent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner deſpiſed all theſe charms of Love, and, like the mad-man in the Goſpel, have
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:135604:95"/>broken to pieces the ſtrongeſt Fetters and Chains. We are, God knows, as deeply ſunk into ſenſuality and bruitiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as thoſe to whom <hi>the Grace of God that bringeth ſalvation</hi> hath never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. 'Tis not credible, (I may ſay poſſible) that men could have been more wicked than they now are, ſuppoſing they had never heard of Heaven or Hell.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>'Tis</hi> a wonder (as any one would think) that thoſe very men who profeſs they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, ſhould ſo groſly and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly contradict his plain Precepts; that thoſe who believe, that <hi>without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> and <hi>that the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven againſt all ungodlineſs,</hi> yet perſiſt in their abominable wickedneſs, and are neither awed with fears, nor animated with hopes.

                        <hi>'Tis</hi> indeed pity, that men ſhould be thus permitted to run headlong to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Alas! is perdition ſo lovely and deſirable, that, like <hi>Rachel,</hi> a double ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude is <hi>thought light for it?</hi> and ſhall wiſe and diſcerning men be Eye-witneſſes
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:135604:96"/>of the bad bargain thoſe men make, and not warn them of their folly? I know this is a duty chiefly incumbent to our ſpiritual Watchmen to diſcharge; I doubt not but many of them ſtand upon their watch, and warn men of their danger. It were to be wiſhed that all and every of them were thus faithful; but ſure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man is in ſome manner concerned to be <hi>his brothers keeper;</hi> and he is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly criminal, who ſhould ſee a mad man running upon danger, and not ſtop him in his courſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I wiſh</hi> ſome new-coined Doctrines had not an inauſpicious influence upon the bad practices of many, had not too much countenanced and authorized vice: but my preſent deſigne is ſo far from controverſial, that I ſhall rather think my ſelf concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to inveigh againſt needleſs diſputes, than ſtart any. If I may ſpeak from my own experience, I ingenuouſly confeſs, I finde Diſputes ſo inſipid and fruitleſs, and in the review ſo unſatisfactory, that I am reſolved henceforth to bid an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal adieu to them, and to condemn them as the great underminers of Chriſtian Piety: And if any ſhall after this fair warning aſſault any Doctrine I have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where owned, I hope diſcerning men
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:135604:96"/>will neither eſteem me nor the Cauſe the worſe, that I draw not my Sword in its defence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And</hi> now what ſhall I ſay more, but conclude with <hi>Moſes</hi>'s paſſionate Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.46. <hi>Set your hearts to the words which I teſtifie to you this day: for it is not a vain thing, becauſe it is your life.</hi> Let us no longer delay and put off this duty; <hi>while it is called to day, let us not harden our hearts through the deceitfulneſs of ſin;</hi> but ſeriouſly <hi>ſearch and try our ways, and turn to the Lord:</hi> this is the proper ſeaſon for ſo neceſſary a work; ere long, there will be no time left us to conſider our ways: <hi>O that in this our day we did underſtand the things that belong to our peace, before they be hid from our eyes!</hi> If men would but be induced to imitate the Pſalmiſts Example, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.59. <hi>I thought on my ways,</hi> I doubt not but they ſhould alſo imitate the courſe he did take, <hi>I made haſte and delayed not to keep thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments:</hi> But men conſider not what they are doing, and ſo no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der though they periſh, no wonder that they prefer darkneſs to light, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe Holineſs as a thing of no value. Let us therefore humbly and heartily
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:135604:97"/>invoke the Father of Lights to open the Eyes of men, whom the God of this world hath blinded, that they may <hi>flee from the wrath to come,</hi> by <hi>cleanſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from all filthineſs of the fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of God.</hi>

                     <p>O Moſt holy and eternally bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>The heavens and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of heavens is thine, the earth alſo, with all that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is.</hi> Thou art everywhere, and canſt not be excluded from any place; but art preſent to the greateſt ſecrets of our Souls, and ſeeſt the cloſeſt and moſt retired thoughts of our Hearts. Thou knoweſt very well with what deſigns and Affections we now bow our ſelves before thee, and canſt not be deceived by any words that we are able to ſpeak in thy praiſe, whilſt our Hearts are far from thy fear and love.</p>
                     <p>Behold, O Lord, our Hearts are full with deſires to be poſſeſſed with a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty reverend ſenſe of thee, and all the benefits thou haſt beſtowed on us; and be lifted up to Heaven in Love to thee,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:135604:99"/>and Joy in thee, whilſt we bleſs and praiſe thee, and ſpeak good of thy Name. We here remember with all humility and thankfulneſs that thou art our Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, and acknowledge thy care and providence over thy antient People, in bleſſing and Sanctifying a day, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou thy ſelf reſtedſt from thy works, that they might ceaſe from all other employments, and admire thy wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful works, extol thy Power, bleſs thy Goodneſs, and be aſtoniſhed at thy Wiſdom, in making, preſerving, adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and governing this excellent frame of the World. <hi>The Heavens declare thy glory, O God, and the Firmament ſheweth thy handy-work.</hi> The Sun, the Moon, and all the Hoſt of Heaven, proclaim the greatneſs and ſplendour of thy Majeſty: <hi>The whole Earth is full of thy rich good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo is the great and wide Sea, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are things moving innumerable, both ſmall and great living Creatures.</hi> There is nothing but what ſpeaks of thee; and above all, the Children of men, whom thou haſt wonderfully made, curiouſly wrought, and impreſſed with thy own Image; that they might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thee, and love thee, in all, and above all things.</p>

Thou giveſt us occaſion not onely to reflect upon all the good things thou haſt provided for our bodies; (which we can never acknowledge enough, the very Health and Eaſe of one day deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the thankfulneſs of many) but we muſt alſo remember, that we are thy redeemed ones, and that thou haſt done great things for our Souls in thy Son Jeſus, who is entred into the Heavens for us, and gone to prepare a reſting place for all thoſe that follow him. This exceeding riches of thy grace infinitely ſurpaſſes all our acknowledgments; ſince all the praiſes we are able to render thee, are leſs than is due for thy tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral bleſſings.</p>

To this we owe thy forbearance in the days of our ignorance, thy unwearied patience towards us in a continued Rebellion, and thy earneſt intreaties of us, when we were paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bent upon our own deſtruction. Thou haſt ſent us, in much love, many Holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructors and Guides to bleſſedneſs; we have had the benefit of ſundry Pious Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, good Examples, holy Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſerious Councels, of the Power of the Holy Ghoſt, and divers reſtraints of Fear, and Shame, and Love; and thou ſtill purſueſt us with thy merciful kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and beſeecheſt us to attend to thy gracious invitations, and receive thy bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and make thee our choice, and be Eternally happy in thy divine favor and likeneſs.

                     <p>MOſt glorious, and everlaſting Lord God, which inhabiteſt eternitie, and dwelleſt in that light which no mortal Eye can attain unto; the God in whom we live, and move, and have our being; we thine unworthy Servants do here in all lowlineſs and humility pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent our Perſons and Prayers before thy Divine Majeſty; confeſſing and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, that we were conceived in ſin, and brought forth in iniquitie; and as if that had been but a ſmall matter, we have heaped up our Actual tranſgreſſions, as the ſand upon the Sea-ſhore, and as the Stars in the Firmament for number: we have broken thy Commandments, we have prophaned thy Sabbaths, we have diſhonour'd thy Name, we have abuſed thy Creatures, we have neglected the day of our Viſitation, and turned thy Grace into wantonneſs, whereby we have moſt juſtly provoked thy wrath and everlaſting diſpleaſure; we have woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded our own conſciences, weakned our aſſurance of Salvation, and grieved thy good Spirit, which ſealeth us up unto
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:135604:106"/>the day of our Redemption. And now, O Lord, if thou ſhouldſt deal with us after our deſervings, thou migheſt pour upon us the deluge of thy wrath and fury, to ſweep us out of the Land of the living, into that place of torment pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the Devil and his Angels. But thou haſt revealed thy ſelf to the Sons of men, to be the Lord, the Lord merciful and gracious, long-ſuffering, and of great goodneſs, who pardons ſins, and paſſeſt by the tranſgreſſions of thy People; this is thy Name for ever, and thy Memorial throughout all Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. We beſeech therefore, for Jeſus Chriſt his ſake, to be merciful unto us, in the free pardon and forgiveneſs of all our ſins, that we have ever committed againſt thee: Accept of his obedience, for our diſobedience; of his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for our unrighteouſneſs; of his ſufferings, for all our ſins: waſh them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in his blood, nail them to his Croſs, hide them in his Wounds, and bury them in his Grave, that they may never riſe up for our confuſion here, or for our condemnation hereafter. O Lord, be unto us a Father of mercy, and a God of conſolation; ſpeak peace unto our Souls and conſciences, and ſay unto us, that
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:135604:106"/>thou art the God of our Salvation. And give us Grace, for the time to come, to dye daily unto ſin, by vertue of thy Sons death, and to riſe up to newneſs of life, by the power of his reſurrection. Wean our Hearts, and take off our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the things of this world, which endure but for a ſeaſon; and raiſe them up unto thoſe things which are at thy right hand for evermore. Enlighten the darkneſs of our underſtanding, ſubdue the ſtubbornneſs of our wills, rectify the diſorder of our affections, and bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to obedience whatſoever exalteth it ſelf againſt thy will; that at laſt we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſuch as thou would'ſt have us to be.</p>
                     <p>Continue and enlarge thy bleſſings upon the Church and Land wherein we live, upon the Perſon and Government of our King: bleſs all the Royal family, together with his Majeſties Councels; the Nobilitie, Magiſtracy, Clergy, and Gentry of the Land: Be merciful to all thoſe who are afflicted with any croſs or calamitie, all our relations and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and all others whom we are bound to pray for.</p>
                     <p>O Lord accept our thankſgivings this Evening, for all the mercies and favors
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:135604:107"/>which thou haſt afforded for our Souls or Bodies, for this Life, or a better; more eſpecially, that thou haſt preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us and our Family this day, in health and happineſs. Now, holy Father, ſeeing the Night is upon us, and we are ready to take our reſt, in thy hands we commit our Souls, and Bodies, and all that we have; beſeeching thee, who art the keeper of Iſrael, that neither ſleepeſt nor ſlumbereſt, to take care of us; for if thou protect us not, Satan will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour us; yea, we ſhall ſleep a perpetual ſleep, and never ariſe up to praiſe thee: we pray thee therefore to be good to us this night, defend us from danger, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh us with comfortable reſt, and raiſe us up to glorifie thee in the duties of the day following; that thou mayſt ſtill be our God, and we may be thy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Hear us and gratiouſly anſwer us in theſe our requeſts, and what elſe thou knoweſt needful and expedient for us, and that for Jeſus Chriſt his ſake, in whoſe moſt bleſſed Name and words, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude theſe our imperfect prayers, ſaying as he himſelf hath taught us,</p>

Mine eyes cannot ſee thee in thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, mine ears cannot hear thee in thy Word, my mouth cannot praiſe thee in thy Works, my hands and feet cannot ſerve thee in my Calling: deſtruction and calamity are in all my ways, and the way of peace I have not known.

                     <p>O Moſt gracious and merciful Lord God, thou haſt called all thoſe that are weary and heavy laden with their ſins to come unto thee, and haſt promiſed to eaſe and refreſh them; thou haſt invited all thoſe that hunger and thirſt after thy Kingdom and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs thereof, to come to thy Table, to taſt of thy ſupper, and haſt promiſed that thou wilt ſatisfy them: in aſſurance therefore of theſe promiſes I come to thee, bleſſed Lord Jeſus, beſeeching thee to eaſe me, to refreſh me, to ſatisfy me with thy mercy; for my Soul hungers and thirſts after thee and thy Salvation. I confeſs and acknowledge that my daily ſins have made me unworthy of my dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bread, much more of this Manna, this Bread of Life that came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.

                     <p>O Lord, <hi>the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort,</hi> I acknowledge and adore thy eternal Power, and Wiſdom, and Goodneſs. I render thee my moſt hearty thanks for all the benefits thou haſt beſtowed on me, from my firſt coming into the world until this time. <hi>Many, O Lord my God, are the wonderful works which thou haſt done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward; they cannot be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and ſpeak of them, they are more than can be numbered.</hi> Above all, I bleſs thee for that great demonſtration of thy Love and Good-will to Mankind by Chriſt Jeſus, whom thou haſt ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world to ſave ſinners; and for bringing me to the clear knowledge of him, and unfeigned affection to thy holy Will declared to us in his bleſſed Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
                     <p>O God, thou haſt taught me from my youth up, and hitherto been marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly gracious to me. Hide not, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, thy face now from me, and put not thy Servant away in diſpleaſure.
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:135604:116"/>Thou haſt been my help, leave me not; neither forſake me, O God of my Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But for Jeſus Chriſt his ſake, I humbly intreat thee to pardon and paſs by all my neglects of thee, and unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to thee, and offences againſt thee. And as I here ſincerely devote and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate my whole ſelf, ſoul and body to thy ſervice; ſo help me, O my God, and further me in the performance of my duty, by the grace of thy holy Spirit. To thee all hearts are open, and from thee no ſecrets are hid: deal with me accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the earneſt deſire and full purpoſe of my ſoul, to conform my ſelf in all things to thy holy Will.</p>
                     <p>Settle in me an immoveable faith in thy infinite Mercies, a conſtant love and chearful affection to my duty, and a readineſs of heart to obey thee, and to ſubmit to thy wiſe appointments in every condition. The whole Earth is full of thy Mercies. That I may rejoyce and be glad all my days, compoſe my broken and diſturbed thoughts, quiet my trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and diſordered ſpirit, and appeaſe all the ragings and tumults there, by a ſweet ſenſe of thy moſt tender mercies, which have been ever of old, and endure continually.</p>

Give me an hearty zeal to do the beſt that I am able; and a ſetled perſwaſion that thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireſt no more of me.</p>
                     <p>Defend me, O my gracious God, from diſhonouring thee, and my Religion, by diſtruſting thy goodneſs, and calling thy loving kindneſs in queſtion towards thoſe that are ſincerely bent to pleaſe thee. Remove all troubleſome imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from me, and give me a clear under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of thee, and of my ſelf; or when I am in darkneſs and confuſion of thoughts, grant me ſo much light and judgment, as not to conclude my ſelf forſaken by thee, but to reflect upon thy long-continued favours to me, and many deliverances of me; that ſo I may reſolve ſtill to hope in thee, to bear my preſent trouble patiently, and to reſign my will abſolutely to thy good pleaſure. And
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:135604:117"/>good Lord, enable me to look beyond theſe clouds, to that bleſſed ſtate whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my Saviour is gone, in which there is no darkneſs at all: and in an humble hope of coming to the ſame place where he is, to content my ſelf with any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition whilſt I am here, ſo far remote from that Region of light and glorie.</p>
                     <p>Hear me moſt loving and merciful Father, I moſt humbly beſeech thee; Pity my great dulneſs and deadneſs of heart. Strengthen my weak and feeble endeavours, ſupport my fainting ſpirit, and cauſe it humbly to hope in thee for ever. Confirm and eſtabliſh every good thought, deſire and purpoſe which thou haſt wrought in me; perfect that which thou haſt begun; make me to grow in wiſdom, faith, love, and willing obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: conduct me hereafter ſo evenly and ſteadily, ſo peaceably and quietly, ſo cheerfully and ſincerely in thy ways, that I may Glorifie thee whilſt I live, by encouraging others to accompany me in thy ſervice; and when I come to die, may reſign my Soul unto thee with an undiſturbed mind, and in an holy hope alſo of a joyful reſurrection of the body, at the great day of the Lord Jeſus, to whom be glory and dominion for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

Firſt therefore, conſider the <hi>ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and miſeries of this life; <hi>That our days conſume in vanity, and our years in trouble;</hi> That our whole life is but a Dream, and when Death awakes us, we find our hands emptie of all that which hath coſt us ſo much labour, and travail, and ſorrow, and ſin.</p>
                     <p>Remember the ſwiftneſs and <hi>ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of Death; That <hi>our days are but a ſpan-long,</hi> and our <hi>flouriſhing</hi> but a <hi>flower of the field,</hi> which though it be not plucked up, yet ſoon withers of it ſelf, and falls away.</p>
                     <p>The young may die ſoon, but the old cannot live long.</p>
                     <pb n="235" facs="tcp:135604:123"/>
                     <p>Remember that in this ſhort life, we are yet to provide for an <hi>Eternity</hi> either of weal or woe; and therefore cannot be too careful how we ſpend every mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute of that upon which depends a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſo great, ſo laſting importance.</p>
                     <p>There is but one way of Birth, but many ways and means of Death: and our life hangs by ſo ſmall a thread, that every little chance is ready to break it off.</p>
                     <p>After Death we are immediately cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to <hi>judgment</hi> before the high Court of Heaven, to give a ſevere account how we have performed that duty to which we were Created; and accordingly to receive an <hi>irrevocable</hi> ſentence of eternal happineſs or miſery.</p>
                     <p>The Judge, before whom we ſhall ſtand, is infinite both in <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Power;</hi> ſo that it is impoſſible either to hide any thing from his all-ſeeing Eye, or to eſcape out of the reach of his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty hand.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Lord cometh in a day when we look not for him, and in an hour when we are not aware.</hi> Let us therefore <hi>watch,</hi> and wait for his coming, <hi>that when he knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, we may open unto him immediately.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How dangerous and deplorable a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition would it be, to be found and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:135604:124"/>
                        <hi>taken</hi> away in the midſt of any <hi>ſin,</hi> or in a continued courſe of ſinful life.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, how happy, and bleſſed, and joyful a thing would it be, to be found practiſing and perſevering in that which is good!</p>
                     <p>Bleſſed is that ſervant, whom his Lord when he cometh ſhall find ſo doing.</p>
